            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen Men are once firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the certainty of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctrine of Eternal Life revealed in the Holy Scriptures of God; there is all reaſon in the World (methinks) to conclude, that the firſt Enquiry ſhould be, How they themſelves ſhall become partakers of it? For who can be imagin'd to be ſincere in his belief of ſo Glorious and Bliſsful a State, that takes no thoughts how he ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, or not ſo many thoughts as what he ſhall eat and drink and put on; that ſits down contented, having given himſelf that cold anſwer which was once given to the Mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> Children, <hi>It ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared?</hi> Therefore to juſtifie the ſincerity of their belief, moſt Men do fancy to themſelves ſomething or other that will entitle them to this happineſs; though not ſo much perhaps becauſe they account it ſo bleſſed
<pb facs="tcp:107613:3"/> a thing to obtain, as dangerous and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to miſs of it.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the many particulars that men do imagine will give them a claim to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life, <hi>The Love of God</hi> is one of the greateſt, and as much pretended to as any. It is ſo Univerſal a Plea, that I ſcarce think there is any Man who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Chriſtian, but he will make it. Not to love God ſounds ſo ill, that it makes the Ears of the moſt Profligate Chriſtian to Tingle, when it is charg'd upon him. But notwithſtanding all theſe pretences to the Love of God, it is moſt Evident that a great part of the pretenders are indeed ſtrangers to it; inaſmuch as they may be convicted <hi>of the Love of the World,</hi> which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with it. To find out and caſt out therefore the Love of the World muſt needs be the moſt important Enquiry and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Man, of every man in the World.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip will eaſily believe me, if I tell you that although Men be never ſo great and high in the World, if the World be great and high in their Hearts, the Love of God is not in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Although Men have never ſo much of this worlds Good, if at the ſame time they be unmerciful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, the Love of God dwells not in them. This is expreſly the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> his Doctrine.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:107613:3"/>
            <p>But to ſpeak a little the cloſer, though a man be inſtructed in all Wiſdome, and furniſht with all Variety of Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that he can name all things as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as <hi>Adam,</hi> or diſcourſe of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as learnedly as <hi>Solomon;</hi> if yet the Love of the World be Predominant in him, he is but a vain pretender to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, a great ſtranger to the Life of Angels. Though a Man know and believe all the wonderful Doctrines deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in the Holy Book, if this Faith do not operate to the purifying of the Heart from the Love of the World, he is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as far from having a true title to the Kingdom of Heaven, as they of whom the Apoſtle gives this Character, That they <hi>Believe and Tremble.</hi> In a word, though a Man be a Member of the Pureſt and moſt Reformed Church, be never ſo Orthodox in his Judgment, never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſpecious in External Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, never ſo even and blameleſs in his Converſation, never ſo exact in Works of Righteouſneſs, and abundant in Works of Charity and Mercy, if yet in his heart he prefer the World before God, he will be interpreted a Lover of the World, and conſequently an Enemy of the Father.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:107613:4"/>
            <p>I do verily believe, my Lord, that I do here preſent you with a Treatiſe written about the moſt Important Enquiry in the World. They are Morning Meditations, ſtollen from the ordinary Employment of my Life; which I do preſent to the World, meerly to advance the Love and Honour of God amongſt Men, and do Dedicate to your Lordſhip, in a grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your kind Reſpects to me; and in Teſtimony of the Honour that I bear to your Lordſhips good Deſign of promoting Piety, and eſtabliſhing Peace in this Nation.

                  <p>REturn, O my mind, Return. What doſt thou ſo early in the World? Art thou not afraid, leſt this unſeaſonable Excurſion ſhould be a Symptom of a Lover of the World? And think, oh think, what a dangerous, what a deadly thing it is, to be a Lover of the World! Thou needeſt no more to convince thee of this, but that one plain Text of the devout Apoſtle St. John, <hi>If any man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107613:10"/>
                  <p>Are not theſe words plain to be underſtood? Are they not ſtartling to any one that underſtands them? But if thou wilt think on a little further, thou wilt find that the whole Goſpel runs in this ſtrain. There is no Doctrine deliver'd either more plainly, or more frequently than this. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> does ſo fully conſent with his Brother <hi>John</hi> in this Doctrine, as if they ſpoke with the ſame mouth, <hi>Jam. 4. 4. The friendſhip of the World is enmity with God: Whoſoever therefore will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of God.</hi> And this he ſpeaks of, either as a Truth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, or very important, as appears by the Interrogatory Form of Speech, wherewith he uſhers it in, <hi>Know ye not?</hi> As if he ſhould either ſay, It is a thing well known, or it is a thing well worthy to be known.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though <hi>junior</hi> to both theſe, yet knew this great Doctrine as well as they, and delivers it almoſt in the ſame words with them, <hi>Rom. 8. 7. The oarnal mind is enmity against God.</hi> He makes the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world, and the Spirit of God directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the one to the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he makes the plain end of Chriſt's giving himſelf for us, to be, that he might deliver us from <hi>this preſent evil world,</hi> Gal. 1. 4. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
                  <p>He makes this to be the great priviledge that he had by Chriſt Jeſus, that by him he was crucified to the World. Writing to his <hi>Philippians,</hi> he makes it the ſhort, but ſure Character of the Enemies of Chriſt, that they <hi>mind earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3. 18, 19. And writing to his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> he gives him the reaſon why <hi>Demas</hi> had forſaken him, and the Work and Profeſſion of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe he was in ove with this World; plainly intimating, That the Goſpel
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107613:10"/> and the World are inconſiſtent, one heart cannot hold them. And all theſe do but in different words ſpeak that which they had heard of, or had been taught by their Lord and Maſter; who, in the days of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, openly declared, <hi>That no Man could ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> Mat. 6. 24. <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> And at another time (as I ſuppoſe) in the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame words, <hi>Luke 16. 13. Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this Doctrine, delivered by ſo many and ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy hands, be true, and cannot be ſpoken againſt, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, O my Soul, Return.</hi>

                     <hi>Strengthen me, O my God, unto the hearty and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Belief of this Propoſition, That I may be as afraid of the prevalent love of the World, as I would dread to be accounted (what is not to be named without horror) an Hater of God!</hi>

                  <p>MY great Deſign ſhall be, to determine the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the World,</hi> and to diſtinguiſh them from the <hi>Lovers of the Father.</hi> Inaſmuch as the Love of God is the <hi>Great Commandment,</hi> and the <hi>Great Teſt</hi> of Chriſtians; and the <hi>Love of the World</hi> is ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it, and excluſive of it, it muſt needs be worthy of the moſt ſerious conſideration of the moſt ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, rightly to ſtate and know the condition of their own Souls in this matter.</p>
                  <p>But it will not be amiſs, firſt to take a general Survey
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107613:11"/> of the words of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 2. 15. and in a preliminary manner, to gloſs upon the ſeveral terms in the Text. After that, I will conſider the <hi>World</hi> in a <hi>Phyſical,</hi> and in a <hi>Theological</hi> Senſe: And <hi>Man</hi> in a <hi>Moral,</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity. The <hi>World</hi> conſider'd in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> Senſe, will afford but little Matter pertinent to my Deſign: But the <hi>World</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a <hi>Theological</hi> Senſe, will comprehend <hi>the Things of the World, the Perſons of the World, the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the World, the Faſhions of the World, the Wiſdom of the World, and the God of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the <hi>Things of the World,</hi> I will comprehend <hi>the Profits of the World, the Pleaſures of the World,</hi> and <hi>the Honours of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whil'ſt I conſider <hi>of the Lovers of the Profits of the World,</hi> I muſt meditate of <hi>Injuſtice, Worldly Confidence, Covetouſneſs, Carefulneſs, Diſcontentedneſs, Impatience,</hi> and <hi>Uncharitableneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I conſider of <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> I muſt meditate of thoſe that uſe <hi>undue means,</hi> for worldly advantage; and thoſe that uſe due means, in an <hi>undue manner.</hi> Under the firſt of theſe will come to be taxt, <hi>Stealing, Defrauding, Lying, Oppreſſion, Bribery.</hi> Under the ſecond will be taxt all thoſe that oſſend in the <hi>Degree,</hi> and in the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of ſeeking the World.</p>
                  <p>When I come to meditate <hi>of the Lovers of the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Wotld,</hi> I muſt conſider of Fleſhly Pleaſures unlawful in their <hi>Matter,</hi> in their <hi>Meaſure,</hi> in their <hi>Manner,</hi> and in their <hi>Seaſon:</hi> And of <hi>Fantaſtical</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, under which I muſt meditate of <hi>Revenge, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Eaſefulneſs:</hi> And under this laſt, will come to be conſider'd <hi>Worldly Fear,</hi> viz. <hi>Fear of Sickneſs, Fear of the Death of Friends, Fear of Poverty,</hi> and <hi>of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I come to conſider <hi>of the Lovers of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107613:11"/> of the World,</hi> it will be proper to meditate of ſeeking the <hi>Approbation</hi> of Men, of Pride in <hi>Birth,</hi> Pride in <hi>Beauty,</hi> in <hi>Apparel,</hi> in <hi>Children,</hi> in <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> in <hi>Riches,</hi> in <hi>Strength,</hi> in <hi>Priviledges,</hi> in <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>Great Place,</hi> in <hi>Vertuous Actions,</hi> and in a <hi>Party</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After <hi>the Things of the World,</hi> will come to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd <hi>the Perſons of the World:</hi> And theſe are either <hi>ones Self, ones Relations,</hi> or <hi>other Men.</hi> Under the firſt will be conſider'd <hi>Self-love,</hi> and the ſeveral kinds of it. To the laſt, will be reduc'd the foul ſin of <hi>Flattery:</hi> When I come to conſider <hi>of worldly Buſineſs,</hi> it will be proper to diſtinguiſh between a <hi>Holy Activity,</hi> and a <hi>Senſual Curioſity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I come to meditate <hi>of the Faſhions of the World,</hi> I ſhall have a fit opportunity to meet with the Sin of <hi>Swearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I come to conſider <hi>of the worldly Wiſdom,</hi> the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> will direct me to meditate of it in this Order, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Impure</hi> Wiſdom, the <hi>Envious</hi> Wiſdom, the <hi>Contentious</hi> Wiſdom, the <hi>Implacable</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the <hi>Mercileſs</hi> Wiſdom, the <hi>Unfruitful</hi> Wiſdom, the <hi>Partial</hi> Wiſdom, and the <hi>Hypocritical</hi> Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>When I come to conſider the <hi>God of this World,</hi> I muſt conſider his <hi>Servants,</hi> his <hi>Allies,</hi> and his <hi>Children.</hi> Under the firſt, I muſt meditate of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Under the ſecond, of <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> And under the third, more particularly of <hi>Self-Willedneſs</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> and in general of the <hi>Deviliſh Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo I will ſhut up this <hi>First Part,</hi> which concerns <hi>Man,</hi> conſider'd in his <hi>Moral Capacity,</hi> with a <hi>Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Meditation,</hi> leſt any one ſhould falſely judge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man to be a Lover of the World, who is not ſo; and endeavor to prevent miſ-judging.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Second Part</hi> I will firſt endeavor to undeceive the Falſe Pretenders to the Love of God, and here
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107613:12"/> meditate of <hi>Monaſtick</hi> Perſons, of the <hi>Votaries of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity,</hi> of the <hi>Votaries</hi> of <hi>Penance;</hi> and of <hi>Quakers,</hi> of <hi>Pretenders</hi> to Charity and Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And having diſeharg'd that Examination, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider <hi>Men</hi> in their <hi>Civil Capacity,</hi> and meditate of <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſts;</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Guardians, Tutors; of Perſons marrying,</hi> and <hi>giving in Marriage, of Patrons; of Chaplains; of Judges and Magiſtrates, Arbitrators, Electors, Jurors; of Landlords and Tenants; of Tradeſmen; of Inn-Keepers; of Beggars; of Wagerers; of Gameſters; of Debtors; of Creditors;</hi> particularly of <hi>Uſurers.</hi> And ſo conclude with ſome <hi>Diſſuaſives</hi> from the love of the World, and <hi>Motives</hi> to the love of God.</p>

                  <p>THE World is taken either in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> Senſe, or in a <hi>Theological:</hi> In a <hi>Phyſical</hi> Senſe, it ſignifies that vaſt Globe, that make up Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, and all things contained in them. But in a <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> Senſe; it is put in oppoſition to God; as it is here in this Text of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> and often elſewhere. The World taken in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> Senſe, is lovely, and the Strength, Beauty, Order, and Variety thereof, are to be Reverently regarded and admired, as the workmanſhip of Infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs. It is very proud and prophane, or very fooliſh, to deſpiſe the World in this Senſe, and to diſregard the Operation of God's Hands. To deſpiſe the Workmanſhip, reflects a Diſhonour upon the Workman; and thoſe that ſee nothing excellent in the World, may be juſtly ſuſpected to ſee nothing above it.

                     <hi>MEDITAT. IV.</hi> Of the World, taken in a Theological Senſe.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>World,</hi> taken in a <hi>Theological</hi> Senſe, is put in oppoſition to God; and ſo it ſignifies all that which is contrary to the Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, and Warreth againſt it, and true Religion; all that which doth not comply with the Will of God, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the hearts of Men from him: And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all that, which, beſides the knowledge and love of God, Men covet, delight in, or lament. In this Senſe it is ſaid, 1 <hi>John 5. 4. Whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the World.</hi> And, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. that the true Believer is crucify'd to the World, and the World to him. In this Senſe, <hi>The Friendſhip of the World</hi> is ſaid, by the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> to be <hi>Enmity against God;</hi> and, by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> to be <hi>hatred of him.</hi> This is ſometimes called <hi>Mammon,</hi> and is put in oppoſition to God: ſometimes it is call'd <hi>our own things,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>things of Jeſus Christ.</hi> And this appears to be the meaning of it in this Text which I meditate upon, by the following <hi>Verſe,</hi> which explains the World, by <hi>the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>the Pride of Life:</hi> which, certainly, if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107613:13"/> they be put together, are of a large Extent. In this Senſe we read of <hi>Worldly Luſts,</hi> Tit. 2. 12. of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The World in a <hi>Theological</hi> Senſe is in general, whatever is not God; and ſo even Life it ſelf may be call'd the World. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> puts the <hi>Theological</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World out of diſpute, in that famous Text, wherein he deſcribes the pure Religion to be a keeping of ones ſelf <hi>unſpotted from the World,</hi> Jam. 1. <hi>ult.</hi> So then the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> means, If any Man love any created Being, or cleaves to it, more than God, or prefers it before him, he is a Lover of the World, and conſequently no Lover of the Father.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>IF any Man love,</hi> &amp;c. The Nobleſt Affection that God hath endu'd the Sons of Men, yea, or the Angels of Heaven with, is <hi>Love.</hi> For when that bleſſed Being was minded to copy out Himſelf upon the rational Creature, He made it apt to love, as He Himſelf is <hi>Love.</hi> God is Love, and the power of Loving, is his Image. However, Liking, and Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Appetite, belong to Beaſts, <hi>Love</hi> properly belongs to the rational Creature: neither can there be any proper Love, without underſtanding and choice. And thoſe <hi>Species</hi> of the rational Creation that are moſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107613:14"/> able to love, or able to love moſt, are the moſt Noble and Divine. Love is the Union of the Soul with the Object beloved, and makes it as much one with it, as it's poſſible to be with a thing that is not our ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now how ſhameful a thing is it, that ſuch Noble Affections ſhould match themſelves ſo baſely; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſuch an excellent Object is in view! The Daughter of a mighty Prince chuſing a Scullion Boy for her Husband, is not ſo unſeemly a ſight, as the Soul of Man enamor'd of the World: neither is the Eagle catching Flyes, or the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hunting a Flea, ſo ridiculous. The Prodigal Gentleman turn'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Commoner with the Swine; or great <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> herding himſelf with the Oxen, is not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. The beautiful Sun indeed, in its kind Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, doth viſit the very Dunghils, (as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God is ſaid to be even in Hell it ſelf) but will not lodge his Beams there. But (alas!) this Noble Off ſpring of Heaven, the rational Soul, how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly doth it lodge and lie down with the World, and reſt in the Embraces of that which is not God! A Debauchery every whit as abominable, as a Humane Body lying down before a Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Our Bodies indeed are a part of the Machine of the World; and it is no great wonder if they be delighted in it, as the Beaſts are: But for Souls and Spirits to immerſe themſelves in, to unite themſelves to material Objects, and mundane Things, is as odious and as monſtrous to behold, as the coupling of living Men to dead Bodies, which the Poet deſcribes as a great piece of Cruelty in the Tyrant <hi>Mezentius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſtyle of the Prophets makes it an Argument of extreme Deſolation, when filthy Birds and Beaſts do reſt in a Land, when wild Beaſts of the Deſart lie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107613:14"/> there, when their Houſes are full of doleful Creatures, and Owls dwell there, and Satyrs dance there, and wild Beaſts of the Wood cry in their Houſes, and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons in their pleaſant Palaces, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> elegantly expreſſeth it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. 21, 22. when the wild Beaſts of the Deſart meet with the wild Beaſts of the Iſlands, and the Satyr cryes to his Fellow, the Shrich-Owl reſts there, the great Owl makes her Neſt, and lays, and hatches, and the Vultures be gathered every one with his Mate, as the ſame Prophet expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34. 14, 15. Filthy Affections do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argoe a deſolate Soul, forſaken of God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn; and do extremely deſile that which was once, and ought to be the Temple of God.

                  <p>YET we muſt conſider, what this Love of the World is, that is ſo dangerous. And here ſure it muſt be granted, even by the devouteſt Lovers of the Father, Negatively:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That it is not every kind glance toward the World that is it. If ſo, we may well ſtand and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ask with the Diſciples of old, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> Although one may apply our Saviours words hither, and ſay, If any Man look upon the World, to luſt after it in his heart, he hath committed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with it: Although Diſcontent, nay, even the very rathering of Things is to be ſuſpected; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is too ſevere to determine every ſingle fond
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107613:15"/> glance toward the World, to be this damnable love of it. There was a famous time, wherein the Sons of God beheld the Daughters of Men; and I think there will be no time, wherein they will be perfectly blind to them: whil'ſt we carry about with us theſe Bodies, it is to be feared that the Beauties and Gayeties of this World will be creeping in at our Senſes or Fancies, and more or leſs infeſting and infecting our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That a moderate ſeeking of the World, ſo as to provide Things honeſt in the ſight of God and Man, is not it. If it were, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another Caſe, We muſt go out of the World: For we ſee there is no living in it, without ſome degree of caring for it.</p>
                  <p>No, it muſt needs be an immoderate, an exceſſive Love that is ſo dangerous and fatal. If it be ask'd, <hi>When that is?</hi> I anſwer, Whenever it prefers the World, or any thing therein, before God and that which God is.</p>
                  <p>Alas, then every ſingle Act of Covetouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the World is preferred before God, is Vicious! Yes, ſo it is, and pernicious, and neceſſarily to be repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. And if it be a Temper, it is that damnable Love of the World here ſpoken of. This Love muſt be predominant, and it muſt be a Temper, or elſe it cannot denominate the Man a damnable Lover of the World. <hi>Lot</hi> committed Inceſt, and I doubt was drunk too; but I do not think the love of Wine or Women was predominant in him: <hi>David</hi> committed Adultery, but I do not think that he was of an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Temper: But they that are carried by a predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant and habitual Love of the World, are the Lovers of the World here ſpoken of; whether they be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, whom God abhorreth; or the Proud, whom he reſiſteth; or the Voluptuous, who are dead to the living Lord</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>IF any Man love,</hi> &amp;c. It ſeems that God doth eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Men by their Loves, not by their Impulſes, nor their Profeſſions; not by their Words, no, nor by their Actions neither. For although it is true, That pure Affections, will ordinarily produce pure Actions; and that as Faith worketh by Love, ſo Love ſheweth it ſelf by Works; yet Actions materially good, do often prom a Principle not Divine and Pure, but Carnal and Corrupt: Therefore the great <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and Tryes of the Reins, viſits and views the hearts of Men, and from thence he values them. It doth not only appear from this Text, but indeed from the whole current of Scripture, that the Eſtimate that God makes of Men is from their hearts. Hence it is that we read ſo often concerning ſuch and ſuch men, that they had ſuch and ſuch Faults and Failings in their Converſation or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet nevertheleſs their hearts are perfect with the Lord: And other men were thus and thus ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and zealous in their Converſation, yet their hearts were not perfect with the Lord: And of others, that they were very formal and forward Profeſſors, but in the mean time their heart went after their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It were endleſs to ſhew the ſpecial regard that God has to the hearts and affections of men.</p>
                  <p>And ought not we to eſtimate our ſelves, as God eſtimates us? <hi>If any man love,</hi> &amp;c. This ſure is the chiefeſt, and, one would think, the eaſieſt thing in the world to be known.</p>
                  <p>It is, without Controverſie, the chiefeſt thing, and moſt material for Man to know concerning himſelf,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107613:16"/> what he loves beſt. If I know that God is the Supreme Good, and that it is my greateſt Duty and higheſt Perfection to love him beſt; it muſt needs follow, that it is my greateſt Concernment to know that I do ſo: For if I once attain to this underſtanding, I will not be beholden to any <hi>Fortune-teller,</hi> to acquaint me with my future condition in this World; nay, I will thank no <hi>Divine,</hi> to fore-tell me my condition in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>Man has nothing Better than his Affections, nothing Nobler than his Heart. Love is better than Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: <hi>Lazarus</hi> in being able to Love, had a nobler Portion than <hi>Dives</hi> in being able to Give: And ſhall this Heart, this Love be given to the World? A Man may converſe in the World, and be concern'd about it, and yet not love it; that's well, that may comfort us: But a Man may alſo know God, talk of him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him, perform many Duties to him, worſhip him with much Pomp and ſeeming Sanctimony, and yet not love him; that may ſtartle us.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie, in all other things, for a Man to tell what he loves beſt: Cannot every man tell, what Diſh of Meat, or what Sort of Drink pleaſes him beſt, or what Neighbor he prefers moſt? And it is not a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Men ſhould not know whether they love God, or the World beſt?</p>
                  <p>Is't not a wonder that Men ſhould be ſo mad or blind, as not to ſee themſelves Lovers of the World? Surely the heart of Man is deceitful, and that not only to other Men, (as ſome would have the meaning of the Text to he) but to himſelf alſo. I never yet knew a Man that would confeſs himſelf to be covetous, though all the Symptoms of Covetouſneſs were upon him: Though the Plague-ſpots and Sores are upon them, yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107613:16"/> they will not confeſs themſelves to be infected. To undeceive (if it may be) the Lovers of the World, is the deſign of the Publication of theſe <hi>Meditations.</hi>

If a man do not love God, he is as bad as a Devil; he is curſed with the chiefeſt curſe; <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be anathemamaranatha.</hi> Who would believe that ſo fearful a thing ſhould be predicated of ſo ſmall a matter! If he had ſaid, If any man blaſpheme God maliciouſly, oppoſe him ſpitefully, commit Murder, be rebellious againſt all Superiors, beaſtly in all Behavior, dwelleth in all Pride and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or the like, then it had been likely enough that he ſhould be eſteemed a hater of God: But to ſay, <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him;</hi> Who can believe this? Is it ſo great a matter to love the world?</p>
                  <p>Yes, from the Predicate, we may infer how great a matter it is. The Spirit of God would not have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated this of a thing of an ordinary ſize, every body declares againſt the ſins of the Fleſh, rails at Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Adultery, Murder, Injuſtice, Extortion; every Body brands Thieves, and ſuch like People: But the ſins of the Spirit go uneſpy'd, and damn mens Souls more effectually.</p>
                  <p>See how damning a thing it is to miſplace affections. Oh how ſadly is the world miſtaken! How weakly do men judge! How many will find themſelves in Hell ſhortly, who had hoped that they were in the Suburbs of Heaven! The common cry is, A very good man, a very honeſt man, a civil good-natur'd Neighbor; but a

                  <p>It is very obſervable how the Commands of the Goſpel are moſtly calculated for the regulating of the affections of Love, Care, Joy, Grief; and how it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids and inveighs againſt the ſins of the Spirit, Pride, Malice, Diſtruct, Envy, Covetouſneſs, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The renovation of the Will, and regulation of the Affections, is the great work of Regenerating Grace. It is paltry Phariſaiſm to mind paying of Tythes, and to neglect the love of God.</p>
                  <p>Say not, oh ſay not, it is a ſmall thing to love the world, but ſay, oh how it defiles, how it expoſes, how it damns, what Idolatry, and Adultery, and Blaſphemy is it!

If the world be got into the <hi>Inn,</hi> the Chambers of the Soul, Chriſt muſt be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Stable.</hi> The ſame Soul cannot at once ſend forth the ſweet aromatick Breathings of Divine Love, and the naſty, noiſom ſtench and exhalation of earthly Love. How ſhould ſuch a limited Agent perform two ſuch contrary Acts at the ſame time?</p>
                  <p>But what, May not a Man love God well, and love the world well too? No: no man loves God well, but he that loves him belt. He only loves him aright, that loves him with all his heart. There cannot be two Beſts: One cannot love God with all his heart, and the world with all his heart too.</p>
                  <p>But may not one love God beſt, and yet love the world? No: For if you love the world unduly, you do not love God beſt; and if you love God beſt, then your love of the world is not the undue love here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
                  <p>The pure and conjugal Love admits no Rival; <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamus non patitur conſortes.</hi> There is an Eſſay, no doubt, to compound the matter, and to make a medley, and this medley, I fear, is the Religion of the moſt. It is too evident, that they entertain the world chiefly; yet in good manners they would allow ſome room for God, ſome little room, upon a Sunday or an Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or perhaps at ſome other times, in ſome eaſie and cheap things. The Whore in the <hi>Comedian</hi> was content to entertain two: the one indeed ſhe properly lov'd; but becauſe the other gave her Preſents and good Gifts, ſhe was content that he ſhould <hi>Haerere in aliqua parte ſaltem apud eam,</hi> ſome little corner of her
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107613:19"/> houſe ſhe would allow him too. It is as certain a ſign of a whoriſh heart, to proſtitute it ſelf to two, as it was of a falſe Mother to admit of the diviſion of the child.</p>
                  <p>The world indeed has no title at all to the heart of Man, and therefore modeſtly deſires only a little part, an inferior love, a ſubordinate love: But together with this ſeeming Modeſty, the Witch is very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for ſhe knows that that part will go night to bring in the whole, and that God will reject the whole Meſs, if any part of it be defiled. But God has a right to all, and therefore demands all or none; he will not take up with a corner of the heart. The love of God fills the Soul where it comes, as the light fills the Fir-mament.</p>

                  <p>To love God was the duty of man before the Goſpel was given, yea or the Law either; neceſſarily reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the relation between the Creature and the Creator. It is moſt agreeable to the dictates of Nature: though it be ſo ſadly depraved, it has not quite put off its Eſſence. For what are Honour, and Reverence, and Adoration, but Love exalted, Love determin'd to a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Object? And this the Heathens always thought juſt and equal to give to their Gods.</p>
                  <p>It is as natural for the ſoul to love, to cleave to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without its ſelf, as for the Ivy to cling to the Oak. The Soul naturally underſtands its own indigency; and therefore goes out to one thing or other to find reſt; though through her Apoſtaſie, ſhe is miſtaken in her object, and fancies reſt, where it is not: Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is rather <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> than <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> The love of a Superior Object, of a Centre, is ſo natural, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from the very conſtitution of the Soul: That Centre muſt needs be ſome Superior Being, and more excellent than it ſelf: And what can that be but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107613:20"/> God; or what beſides him can be ſayd to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Soul it ſelf? God is remotely concern'd in the purſuits even of the Covetous and Ambitious; howbeit they mean not ſo, and therefore their in judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tendencies are no thanks to them, nor will ever make them happy.</p>
                  <p>To love the Lord our God with all our heart is the great Commandment indeed; it is the Law of Nature, inlay'd in the very conſtitution of the Soul, belonging to all men in all ages of the world.</p>

                  <p>THe Love of God is Excellent and Honourable; it puts a Beauty and Luſtre upon the Soul. This beautifies, dignifies, glorifies, yea, and in a ſenſe, deifies the Soul, uniting her to God, and ſo making her one with her Maker. As Worldly Love diſhonours and defiles; as he that is joyned to an Harlot, is one with an Harlot, even a Limb of a Whore; and he that is joyned to the World in Spiritual Adultery, is a Limb of the World: ſo he that is joyned to Chriſt is a Member of Chriſt. The Soul acts moſt nobly, exalts it ſelf moſt bravely, when it ſpends its powers upon the ſupream good. If there be any <hi>Apotheoſis</hi> of Souls this is it. The Saints are the moſt excellent of the Earth; and this is the Character of Saints, that they love God: <hi>Love ye the Lord all ye his Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this I ſhall have occaſion to enlarge my <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> hereafter. I will therefore proceed to think a little of the abſolute neceſſity of the Love of God.</p>
                  <p>The Love of God is ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the happineſs of Souls, that no Soul can be happy that hath it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in him. The precept makes it neceſſary, which commands it in both Teſtaments, and that over and over again, and that as the principal Duty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107613:21"/> of Man. It is a Commandment, nay, it is a great, it is the <hi>great</hi> Commandment, as our Saviours words are tranſlated, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 38. Now after all theſe inculcations, can we imagine that God will diſpenſe with this; nay, with the leave of the Popiſh Caſuiſts be it ſpoken, he cannot: for it is a neceſſary means of Happineſs: God himſelf cannot make a Soul happy that hates him.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering the conſtitution of the rational Soul, it is impoſſible that any thing ſhould be his happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Communion with God: Now there can be no Communion, no Converſe without Love. Can a Soul dwell with him for ever, and be happy in ſo doing, that does not love him? Ye hated me and caſt me out, ſays <hi>Jephthah:</hi> Certainly the haters of God, do <hi>ipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facto,</hi> caſt themſelves out of the preſence of God.</p>

                  <p>IF <hi>any Man Love the World,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>But perhaps there are others, ſome others, that will inquire.

                  <p>BUt poſſibly there may be ſome ingenious Inquirer, that with <hi>Philip,</hi> will ask and ſay, <hi>Shew us the Father and it ſufficeth.</hi> To him Chriſt anſwered, <hi>Have I been ſo long with you, and ſayeſt thou, ſhew us the Father?</hi> As if he had ſaid, the inviſible God is ſeen in me; I am the Image of the Father. So I ſay to theſe, God is inviſible, but the Image of God is viſible in the World.</p>
                  <p>The Image of God idneed is ſeen in the whole Creation, and the Power, Wiſdom, and goodneſs of God, are to be obſerved and admired therein.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially it is to be admired in Man. Man is more eſpecially the Image of God; and if we ſay we love God, whom we have not ſeen, and love not our Brethren whom we have ſeen, we deceive our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>More eſpecially it is to be obſerved in good Men: Therefore is the Love of God ſo often deſcribed by the Love of the Brethren, and of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>But principally, True Goodneſs is the Nature of God. God is Goodneſs, Truth, Love, Holineſs;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107613:23"/> and he that loveth the World more than theſe, is the Idolater and Adulterer here ſpoken of. If any Man habitually in his Judgment or Affections, prefer the Pleaſures, Profits, or Honours of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, Truth and Holineſs, he is dead accurſed.</p>
                  <p>I ſuſpect that the Love of Chriſts Perſon is moſtly a Notion amongſt Men: To follow his Example, to imitate his Graces, to copy out his Perfections, is to Love him. For although we have not heard Gods Voyce, nor ſeen his Shape at any time, yet if his Word abide in us, we love him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 37, 38.</p>
                  <p>He that loveth Chriſt muſt keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: If any man therefore prefer the world before the Commands of Chriſt, before the favour of God, or the peace of his own Conſcience, ſo far he is a lover of the World. The ſon of the bond-woman, and of the free, cannot cohabit: fleſhly wiſdom, and the grace of God, cannot at the ſame time predominate. The love of God is a nature, not a rapture or extaſie, much leſs a Mechanical thing, Acted only upon the Stage of Fancy.</p>

                  <p>BUt what, is the love of the world ſo peſtilent, ſo malignant, ſo poyſonous, that no love of God will grow by it in the ſame Soul?</p>
                  <p>Yes, there may be a great deal of ſpurious love, love of a falſe kind, more properly called flattery than friendſhip. Men may fancy they love God much, and may cry, God forbid but they ſhould love him above all things. Perhaps there may be ſome true love in a weak degree; true I mean in oppoſition to diſſembled,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107613:23"/> Phyſically true (for why may there not be a true love, that is not ſaving?) But he that loves God aright, as the ſupream good, muſt needs love him with a ſupream and ſuperlative affection.</p>
                  <p>But be it true or no in a Phyſical ſenſe; that love of God is not higheſt, doth not prevail nor predominate, that is eaſily cruſht, caſt out, gain-ſaid. If the Tares get above the Corn and ſmother it; if the cares of the world choak the word, thoſe tares and cares are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant.</p>
                  <p>The men of <hi>Keilah</hi> made love to <hi>David,</hi> perhaps they had ſome real kindneſs for him; but their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for <hi>Saul</hi> was greater: ſo that if he offer'd himſelf, they would caſt forth <hi>David</hi> and his men.</p>
                  <p>The love of God and the love of the World are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent. And that appears from the nature of the objects, which are contrary the one to the other: As alſo from the nature of love. <hi>If any man love the World,</hi> muſt be underſtood of a prodominant love; then <hi>the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> muſt be underſtood of a predominant love alſo. God being the chiefeſt good, the love of him muſt be the higheſt and ſtrongeſt, or elſe it is not ſuch as the object requires. If a Woman love her Husband well, yet if ſhe love him not above any other man, ſhe does not love with a right conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal love, which ought to be ſtrongeſt of all others. The proper and acceptable love of God muſt needs be predominant, otherwiſe it is not fitted to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſupream good: Now it is impoſſible there ſhould be two predominant loves in the ſame Soul at one and the ſame time.</p>

                  <p>BUt it will be askt, what goes to make a Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant love?</p>
                  <p>Love, yea even the love of God, is capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and remiſſion. There are thoſe that depart from their firſt love in a great meaſure. The Spouſe was one while ſick of love, another while ſo lazy and languid, that ſhe would not ſo much as ariſe to open to her beloved when he knockt. Particularly, by how much worldly love prevails, by ſo much Divine love languiſheth and is invalidated. They are like the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> the riſe of the one is the fall of the other, and they cannot be both ſupream in one <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> They are like a pair of Scales in this, as the one riſes, the other falls; but they differ in this, that they are never equally poys'd.</p>
                  <p>A Predominant Love muſt be moſt <hi>intenſe</hi> in degree, <hi>habitual</hi> and <hi>durable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The intenſeneſs of the love of God is ſo deſcrib'd, as I never read any thing like it, <hi>Luk 10. 27. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind.</hi> How many Alls are here? And yet if we had ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more powers and principals, we ought to love God with them all too: It is an emphatical tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of that elegant Text of the Apoſtle <hi>(Rom. 5. 5.) The love of God is ſhed abroad in our Hearts;</hi> which if I might Periphraſe upon in Scripture Phraſe, I would call it a covering of the Soul, as the Waters cover the Sea. The Soul of a lover of God ſeems to its ſelf too ſcant to comprehend the ſupream good; wiſhes its ſelf wider and larger. Oh that one would give me the large
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107613:24"/> heart of an Angel; oh that God would fill up all my capacities, and make me yet more capacious; oh that he would take up all the room in me, and oh that he would make for himſelf more room in my Soul, than yet there is, to entertain him!</p>
                  <p>And certainly this Predominant Love may be diſcern'd: If I know not what I love beſt, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Why may I not as well know whether I love God or the World beſt, as I know whether I love bread or husks beſt? By what we conſtantly chooſe, when things come in competition, we may know what we love beſt.</p>
                  <p>But may not the palate of the mind be ſo alter'd or vitiated (as well as that of the body) that what I chooſe at one time, I may refuſe at an other, and prefer its contrary or diſparate? Yes certainly: In every ſingle wilful deliberate Act of Covetouſneſ or Impatience, worldly love does predominate <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc:</hi> But it will not denominate the man a lover of the world except it be habitual.</p>

                  <head>MEDITAT. XX. <hi>Of Habitual love.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe love that is ſo predominant, as to denominate, muſt be <hi>Habitual.</hi> But may not an habitual lover of the World be converted into an habitual lover of God? Yes ſure: This is the converſion that the Goſpel ſpeaks of. To turn men from Idols to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the true God is not a ſaving conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To turn them from the commiſſion or love of ſome ſingle ſin of the fleſh, as Drunkenneſs, Whoring, Swearing, is a partial, but not a ſaving Converſion. The great and ſaving Converſion lies in changing the Temper, the Nature, and introducing Divine Habits.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:107613:25"/>
                  <p>The habit of worldly love may be deſtroyed, and is deſtroy'd in all ſincere Converts. The habit of Divine love may be interrupted in its Acts, weakened in its Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, but ſhall not be quite deſtroy'd. We read of ſome indeed that they had left their love, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4.) But it does not appear that they had quite loſt it: or if we will ſay that they had loſt it, yet it was not it, but ſome <hi>degrees</hi> of it that they loſt; not their <hi>love</hi> but their <hi>firſt love,</hi> or ſome degrees of that love which they had at firſt. I know not what ſhould hinder, but that every truly regenerate and habitual lover of God, may make the ſame challenge as the Apoſtle did, <hi>What ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the love of God?</hi> If it be ſaid that the love of God towards his Elect is immutable and indefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctible, but ſo is not theirs towards him: One may well reply, that conſequently the love of the Elect is laſting, everlaſting too. If it be true, that whom God loves he loves to the end, and that he loves none with this peculiar love, but thoſe who love him, it will fairly follow, that their love is endleſs too.</p>

                  <p>ANd now methinks I ſee the ſecure world ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd, every one bleſſing himſelf, Oh I am not this accurſed lover of the world. I do indeed now and then prefer the world, my gain, my pleaſure, my reputation before God, and the obſervation of the dictates of my own Conſcience, as I perceive all men do, but I do not make a conſtant cuſtom of it; I have no habit of it.</p>
                  <p>But hark a while, though it be but in one ſingle Act that thou preferreſt the World before God, or in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107613:25"/> a ſin committed now and then, yet glory not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it not a light thing. It is ſomething ſure, and indeed enough to humble and amaze all Men upon Earth, to be now and then guilty of ſuch folly and filthineſs, ſuch Blaſphemy, Unrighteouſneſs and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as this is, to be but once guilty of preferring the Devil before God.</p>
                  <p>But examine, Oh look inwardly, Do not theſe acts proceed from an habit, theſe ſprouts from a root; we had need to ſearch narrowly, and examine ſtrictly; for if we be miſtaken here, we are miſtaken indeed, fatally, everlaſtingly miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>The worldly mind generally denies and palliats its worldlineſs. Men are generally aſham'd to be call'd worldly minded men, and very loath to believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſuch: notwithſtanding which, it is moſt certain that there are many ſuch; ſo that ſomewhere there will be found a deadly damning miſtake.</p>

                  <p>Lord, How little do I diſcern this Diſeaſe, or lay it to Heart in my ſelf? How little do I mourn over it in others, where it is apparently praedominant, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is ſo deadly?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Alas, How early, how earneſtly, how eagerly, have I purſued the World in my Thoughts, in a

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXIII.</hi> Notwithſtanding Mens Self-deceivings, there are many Lovers of the World.</head>
                  <p>ANd becauſe no Man will confeſs himſelf to be a Lover of the World, are there therefore none ſuch? Has the Apoſtle ſuppos'd an Impoſſibility or a <hi>Non Entity,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>If any Man love the World,</hi> &amp;c. or are Men therefore not of the World, becauſe they ſay they are not of the World? Whether it be meet to hearken unto God, and believe him, or Man, let us now judge.</p>
                  <p>We may eaſily ſuppoſe Man to be bribed and blinded in his own caſe. What the judgment of God is we ſhall ſoon diſcern in his Word; by which we may briefly examine all the Ages of the World.</p>
                  <p>The primitive ſtate of Man, no doubt, was a ſtate of pure and Divine Love. As the Creator is ſaid to take pleaſure in the workmanſhip of his Hands, ſo doubtleſs the rational Creature delighted himſelf in his Creator; and in him only admired himſelf and the reſt of the Creation.</p>
                  <p>But this laſted not long. Alas, how ſoon did the worldly Spirit begin to prevail! <hi>Cain</hi> the Heir of the World choſe the World for his portion; and the love of the Father (his Grandfather) was not in him. <hi>For if a Man love not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Old World neglected Righteouſneſs and the Preacher of it. We read what their main ſtudy was; they were intent upon Marrying, Building, Planting, and ſuch like ſenſual entertainments, and choſe that part, till they were taken away from it. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Antediluvian World, we ſhall find that it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107613:27"/> had but few Men in it, but who were worldly Men. Next take a view of the World that follow'd the Flood, and reſolv'd that the Flood ſhould never follow them, I mean the Babelites and the Men of that Age, the Senſual <hi>Nimrods,</hi> the Capacious Giants, the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Canaanites, Amorites, Perizzites;</hi> and the reſt of that Herd; and what can we find amongſt them but Worldlineſs, Violence and Uncleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>But there was another Seed, and ſure that was all Holy; I mean the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Seed of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> no, it is too evident that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed; witneſs the many hundred thouſands that luſted after the Fleſh-pots, nay, the very Onions and Garlick of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that prefer'd their Bondage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promiſed Land, and the free exerciſe of their Religion.</p>
                  <p>Follow them into that Land, and take notice of their great Idolatry, and other Iniquities committed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and almoſt generally, under the Government of their Judges. Nay, view them under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their beſt Kings, and take an account from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> own mouth, and you will find that even then there wre many that ſaid, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> or, if you will, in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Metre, the greater ſort cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved worldly Gods. Not long after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſo bad, that the poor Prophet thought that he was left alone a Worſhipper of the Father.</p>
                  <p>In the days of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> rich and poor, and all were ſo univerſally apoſtatiz'd, that by crying a good man up and down the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> one was not to be found, <hi>Jer. 5. in prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In the days of the Son of Man, the beſt ſort of Men (reputed) were Lovers of the World, more than of the Father; or if you will have it in our Saviours own words, <hi>They loved the praiſe of men, more than the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107613:27"/> praiſe of God;</hi> they received honour one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>And how men ſtood affected in the following times, his Followers will tell us; one Apoſtle declaring, <hi>That all men ſought their own things;</hi> and another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, <hi>That the whole world lay in wickedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the world be ſo mended in theſe dregs of time, that none of this Breed are left, we ſhall need to expect no new Heavens, nor new Earth, wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteouſneſs.

                  <p>THere are then, nay, there are many Lovers of the World: But what <hi>Jehu</hi> will now appoint us a Sacrifice for the Worſhipers of <hi>Baal</hi> (for they skulk amongſt the People) whereby we may diſcern them.

                  <p>In general, it is certain, That in the matters of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering, there are multitudes to be found.</p>
                  <p>In doing, They that account any of the known Commandments of God ſo heavy, ungrateful, and troubleſom, that they wilfully refuſe to do them, are Lovers of the World. The Lovers of God do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things he commands them, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 14.) they follow the Lamb, let him lead them whether he will. <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Friend of God, is fam'd for his chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience in hard and grievous things; as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking his own Land, to go he knew not whither, and in ſacrificing his beloved <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Oh ſevere Command!
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107613:28"/> but oh Angelical Obedience! To the Lovers of God, his Commands are not grievous. Loving <hi>Paul,</hi> whom the Love of Chriſt conſtrain'd, was ready to do any thing, to take any pains, for the Name of Jeſus, and the honour of it.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of Suffering, They that will not quit all worldly intereſts, rather than diſown Chriſt, or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deliberately violate a known Commandment, are Lovers of the World more than of God.</p>
                  <p>Sufferings try men: If ye ſeek me, if ye cleave to me, ſaith God, let theſe things go, leave your hold of the world, quit your worldly intereſt. This is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcated in the Goſpel, that it ſeems needleſs to bring any particular proof. Thoſe famous general Texts are enough, if they be but glanc'd at: If any man take not up his Croſs, he cannot be my Diſciple. If any man will not deny Father and Mother, Houſe and Lands for my ſake, he is not worthy of me. If a man will not cut off his right hand, and pluck out his right eye for Chriſt, he is not a Lover of him.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider the World in a <hi>Phyſical</hi> ſenſe, and it is certain, that whoſover loves, admires, enjoys the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107613:28"/> World, and the Beauties thereof, in a way of <hi>oppoſition</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>competition</hi> with him, or indeed <hi>ſeparation</hi> from him, is not a right Lover of the Father.</p>
                  <p>However beautiful the Fabrick of the World is, we ought not to love it in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to God, not eſteem the Creature in a way of derogation from the Creator. It's true, a Man may (with <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi>) ſay, <hi>Digitus Dei eſt hic,</hi> and ſeem to own the goodneſs and power of God in the Creation, and yet be a meer <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian:</hi> But yet no true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> will ſay, <hi>Digitus Dei non est hic;</hi> no Lover of the Father, will exalt the power of natural cauſes ſo, as to exclude the Author of them. It becomes a <hi>Royal Society</hi> to admire the King of Heaven; and if any man ſtudy and admire the World in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to God, he is an Atheiſtical Lover of the World.</p>
                  <p>He that loves the World, or values it in <hi>competition</hi> with God, is (at leaſt) a falſe Friend of God; and acts, as if he would ſet the Creature at variance with the Creator.</p>

                  <p>Men are commonly proud of much knowledge; but the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome that are proud, and yet know nothing, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4.)

A complete Murder indeed, to kill Soul and Body at once. How many have deny'd the Lord that bought them, blaſphemed, ſaid even to Sin it ſelf, <hi>Make me as one of thy hired Servants, put me to any
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107613:29"/> drudgery whatſoevere, ſo I may but eat Bread and live.</hi> Theſe are they that <hi>find</hi> their Lives in the <hi>loſs</hi> of their Souls, but they ſhall loſe them. Alas! there are too many that will commit any ſin, as well as undergo any ſlavery, to live: Many <hi>Jaberites,</hi> that to ſave their Lives, ſuffer (at leaſt) one of their eyes to be put out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mean, embrace Idolatry in a blind obedience.</p>
                  <p>And is Life ſo ſweet, as to be preferred before Truth, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs? ſo ſweet, as to be preferred before God the uncreated Life? It is indeed the higheſt Temptation, as the Devil too truly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and they are more excuſable that ſin to preſerve Life, than they that ſin to maintain Honour or Eſtate; but yet inexcuſable too. The Church would not do ſo, <hi>Pſal. 44. 17. All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nor dealt falſly in thy Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But did not <hi>Peter,</hi> to ſave his Life, deny his Lord? Yes, and <hi>Peter</hi> was in that Act a predominant Lover of the world. We know how dear it coſt him: And if any man will encourage himſelf by his example, let him be ſure of his Repentance, before he venture as he did. Many have deny'd their Lord, and never owned him more; have ſo run away, as never to return or look back; and that by a juſt judgment of God, who thereupon gives men up to believe Lyes: and commonly the next thing is, to find out ways to juſtifie and defend their ſin.</p>
                  <p>To prefer Life before Truth under any Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a ſingle Act of worldly Love; but being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the ſin, yet to live in it, onely to preſerve the Life ſo ſtolen, denominates an habitual Lover of the world. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaved his Life, by abjuring his Lord; but he did not maintain it ſo. Yea, ſome have given back their Lives ſo feloniouſly obtained to the flames; have ſought out the Executioner, have voluntarily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107613:30"/> up their Lives, as being unwilling to keep them upon ſuch baſe terms.</p>
                  <p>All that uſe unjuſt means to preſerve Life, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves in the uſe of ſuch means, are predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Lovers of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, let me hate that Life, that must be purchaſed at ſo dear a rate, as Divine diſpleaſure!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> one conſulting the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> the other the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> are recorded for wicked men, and were ſadly rewarded too; both loſt their Lives, ſeeking unduly to preſerve them: ſo true is that of Chriſt, in more ſenſes than one, <hi>He that findeth his Life, ſhall loſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many things may be quitted to preſerve Life: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham</hi> told a Lye or no to ſave his Life, or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſinned in denying his reaſon before the King of <hi>Gath,</hi> or the <hi>Hebrew Midwives</hi> lyed to ſave the Lives of the Infants, is doubtful; much may be ſaid to clear them all. But that a man may with <hi>Abraham,</hi> deny himſelf of the Converſation of his Wife for a time; forſake his Countrey with <hi>David,</hi> yea, though the Houſe of God were there; that he may make ſome diſguiſes of himſelf; that he may uſe ſome pretences and excuſes, is evident from the example of <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he went to anoint <hi>David;</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when he diſcours'd the King about rendering up the City to the <hi>Caldeans.</hi> It is evident, that men may part with their Eſtates to ſave their Lives, as in the caſe of danger of Shipwrack; or with ſome part of their Liberty, as Chriſt quitted his opportunity of teaching the People for a time; that they may with <hi>Moſes,</hi> forſake their Countrey, and their Fathers Houſe: But it will in no caſe become lawful, to quit ones Integrity for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life; to prefer Life, before Virtue; and ſo, <hi>Propter vitam vivendi perdere cauſas. Lord, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107613:30"/> this Love, this inordinate Love of Life, which puts us upon ſo many ſinful ſhifts to maintain it, and let us love Life only in thee!</hi>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXVII.</hi> Of Unwillingneſs to Dye.</head>
                  <p>2dly, <hi>IF any man be not willing to lay down his Life at the Will of God, he is a Lover of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Will of God is juſt, righteous, pure, perfect, and more deſirable than Life it ſelf. The Will of God is God himſelf, and he that reſiſteth, or oppoſeth, or is not chearfully ſubject to the Will of God, whether his preceptive or diſpoſitive Will, is a Rebel.</p>
                  <p>Alas! How little Conſcience do men ordinarily make of inward hearty ſubmiſſion to the Will of God! They are always reckoning theſe Murmurings and Diſcontents, and Acts of Self-will, amongſt humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, at worſt; but ſuch as they deſire not to be cured of neither. God ſays, <hi>Come away;</hi> the ſelfiſh worldly Nature cryes, <hi>I will not come, or yet a while longer.</hi> And what is Rebellion, if this be not? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but that God takes ill all that reluctancy and lothneſs that is found in us, as he did in <hi>Lot,</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember her, O my Soul, when ever thou offerest fondly to look after worldly things, in any way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy against the Will of God!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid, <hi>Have not good men been unwilling to dye, when they have known it to be the Will of God to remove them? Was not</hi> Hezekiah <hi>loth to ſtir, when he had a Meſſage ſent him from Heaven,</hi> Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye?</p>
                  <p>To this I reply, If good men have been guilty of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107613:31"/> this Lothneſs and Non-compliance, it is no part of their goodneſs. Good men are never the better for many things that are recorded of them in Scripture; yea, make the beſt we can of it, certainly it is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to be loth to dye; and if it be no worſe, I am ſure a wiſe man will not be proud of it, nor a good man pleas'd with it.</p>
                  <p>The beſt and moſt perfect Saints have been uſually willing to dye. There was no more to do with <hi>Aaron,</hi> but <hi>Go up into this Mountain, and put off thy Cloaths, and dye there; and he went up and undreſt himſelf, and dyed.</hi> No more to do with <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>Go up into this Mountain, and ſee the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and dye; and he went up and ſaw, and dyed.</hi> If I ſhould here ſtand to take a View of the way of the Saints enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Death, I ſhould find that all of them entertain'd the Summons of Death contentedly, many chearfully, and ſome not ſo much <hi>chearfully</hi> as <hi>greedily:</hi> onely <hi>Hezekiah</hi> deſired to <hi>live a little longer,</hi> to ſee the Kingdom <hi>ſettled,</hi> and (as it ſhould ſeem) to ſee an Heir of the Crown, and it muſt be made an example to encourage Lingringneſs, and Lothneſs to dye. It's true, he prayed to <hi>live,</hi> but whether he was <hi>abſolutely unwilling</hi> to dye or no, or whether he reſiſted the <hi>Will of God,</hi> I dare not determine, and I know no body can prove: For even Chriſt himſelf prayed, <hi>That the Cup might paſs from him;</hi> yet with ſubmiſſion of his <hi>Will, Not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi>

                     </gap>dly, <hi>IF any man be content to ſpend his Eternity in this world, in this imperfect ſtate, though it were ſuppoſed to be ſinleſs, he hath not arrived at that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107613:31"/> degree of Divine Love, as becomes every Chriſtian to aſpire unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the prodigal Soul do truly repent, if he do ſee that there is a Dearth in the whole Creation, an inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the world to entertain him, he will reſolve to return to his Fathers houſe: And he that could be content for ever to <hi>dwell</hi> in a ſtrange Land, and take up with the Husks that are there, declares himſelf a ſtranger to the Bread of his Fathers houſe.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſome one will doubt, and ask, <hi>Whether there be any man ſo fond of Life, as to wiſh to live Eternally in this Body?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That men <hi>plainly</hi> ſee and know that they cannot, they muſt not ſpend their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity here, and therefore will not confeſs they deſire any ſuch thing, accounting it a ſhame to be thought to be fond of a thing impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>But yet <hi>really</hi> many men wiſh it might be ſo, as having no View, Belief, or Hope of a better ſtate. The extremities of old Age indeed do force men to wiſh for death, who yet have no good mind to dye: but if any <hi>worldly</hi> man could live in health, peace, and youthful vigor, it is not to be doubted but that he would be <hi>well content</hi> to live here always. The Poets make themſelves ſport with one <hi>Tithonus,</hi> who wiſh'd for Immortality in this world; and it was granted him, <hi>That he ſhould never dye:</hi> But he had forgot to put in this, <hi>That he ſhould not grow old neither;</hi> ſo that when he was extremely grown with old Age, and good for juſt nothing, he would fain have dyed, but could not: But if God would add indefectibility of wealth, health and ſtrength, to Immortality, no doubt but that every <hi>worldly</hi> man would put up <hi>Tithonus</hi>'s Prayer.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, wiſhing to <hi>live</hi> another day, and yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and then another, is a kind of wiſhing to <hi>live eternally</hi> here.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:107613:32"/>
                  <p>He is ſtrangely forgetful of himſelf, and his true intereſt, unkind to his own centre, who does not breathe after a ſtate of Perfection to come: And he that does ſo aright, will be growing up into it here. He that rightly deſires Heaven, would not <hi>willingly</hi> ſtay for all of it till the world to come. That which the Poet accounted vicious in the Sons of Men, is virtuous and <hi>laudable</hi> in the Sons of God, <hi>Filius ante diem,</hi> &amp;c. even in this preſent Life, to lay hold upon <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then, muſt men leap out of the Body? No, but live above the Body, grow up into a Godlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, into a reſemblance of Chriſt Jeſus, which is Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Whil'ſt we live in this Body we cannot be happy, by reaſon of our Senſes, Fancies, Appetites; we muſt needs therefore deſire a better Body, if we ſtudy our own Felicity: Yea, ſuppoſe the beſt, that we could live without ſin, yet all this while we are but of a low Form, we are capable of more <hi>excellent accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> It becomes a truly generous mind to aſpire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perfection, after a complete reſt in its centre, after the fulleſt enjoyment of the Supreme Good.</p>

                  <p>This Thirſt after Happineſs, is often made a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Lovers of God, and of his Son Jeſus. Chriſt deſir'd, <hi>that where he was, his followers might be alſo;</hi> and why ſhould not his Followers be ſo kind to themſelves?</p>
                  <p>If we view thoſe Texts ſeriouſly, which deſcribe the Lovers of God, we ſhall find this ever and anon to be their character, <hi>That they love the appearance of Christ Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>that they wait for the mercy of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ unto Eternal Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is it not a ſin, to be diſcontent at our ſtay in this world?</p>
                  <p>To be diſcontent at the Will of God, muſt needs be evil; for true happineſs conſiſts in conformity of will to the Will of God: But to long after reſt, and that in God, cannot be interpreted to be an intemperate Act.</p>
                  <p>It is an Act of Faith and Patience to be content to live. To deſire death out of wearineſs of afflictions, and the Diſcipline of God, is weak and cowardly: But
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107613:33"/> to be weary of our diſtance, abſence, imperfect ſtate, and to long after Perfection, and daily to grow up into it, is ſafe, good, proper, generous, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>

What entertainment findeſt thou in husks, that thou art ſo unmindful of the Bread of Life? What an unſeemly thing is it to be haled home; to hide thy ſelf (with</hi> Saul) <hi>amongst the ſtuff, when thou art ſought for to be crowned.</hi>

                  <p>NOW I will conſider the World in a <hi>Theological</hi> ſenſe, and thus it denotes any thing that has oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to God. And ſo we read of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the World, the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the World, the <hi>Men</hi> of the World, the <hi>Faſhions</hi> of the World, the <hi>Sorrow</hi> of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The World in general is, whatſoever is not God; and ſo even <hi>Self</hi> may be called the World.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:107613:33"/>
                  <p>Whoſoever loveth any thing, or cleaves to it more than to God, or habitually prefers it before him, is a lover of the world.</p>
                  <p>But I will view more particularly, what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comprehends under the Notion of the World, in a Theological Senſe.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall begin with the <hi>profits</hi> of the world, the riches and treaſures of it; which have almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſt the name of the world, as being a principal part of it, to which the generality of men are addicted.</p>
                  <p>This I take eſpecially to be meant by <hi>Mammon,</hi> which one cannot ſerve in conſiſtency with God. Whoſoever prefers the profits and riches of the world before God, the ſame is a lover of the World.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak my judgment freely, I think there are many things more valuable than ſilver and gold. Learning and Valour are better; all the ornaments and accompliſhments of the Mind are better than they; friends are better; health and peace are better.</p>
                  <p>It is a wonder to me, that men ſhould loſe their peace, forfeit their friends, expoſe their health for theſe things. Although (I confeſs) it is not Idolatry, becauſe theſe things are not God; yet it is abſurd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly, and diſingenious, to prefer riches before theſe things, becauſe theſe are really better.</p>
                  <p>To ſay I had rather be a Prince than a Philoſopher, argues a low mind.</p>
                  <p>But to value theſe riches more than God, more than truth, goodneſs, and purity, makes an idolatrous lover of the World. To ſeek theſe more then the Kingdom of God, to hunger after them more than after righteouſneſs, to confide in them more than in the Promiſe and Providence of God, doth denominate the accurſed perſon here ſpoken of.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitableneſs,</hi> and the ſeveral Branches of theſe.</p>
                  <p>I begin with <hi>Injuſtice.</hi> They are all unjuſt, who either uſe undue means, or a due means in an undue manner, to get worldly advantage, and therein are lovers of the World, more than of God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> is in the uſe of <hi>undue means.</hi> And ſo <hi>Stealing, Defrauding, Lying, Oppreſſing, Bribery,</hi> are a preferring the world before Righteouſneſſe, Truth, and Mercy; and Conſequently denominate a lover of the World more than of God.</p>
                  <p>According to this Method, I muſt begin with <hi>Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> God is righteous; the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, whoſover therefore loves not it, loves not him: whoſoever Steals prefers the World before it, and conſequently does not love it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sealing</hi> is a violation of property. Let property be what it will in its own nature, be it not a ſacred thing, be it a neceſſary evil, or be it a good not ſimply neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; yet it is now neceſſary, as things go with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It cannot well be deny'd, Theft ſuppoſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and property ſuppoſes Apoſtaſie: If Man had continued in his Primative Eſtate, it is likely the Earth had been as free to his innocent Off-ſpring as the Air is at this day. At firſt, there was no encloſure but of one poor Tree; neither ſhall there be any in the World to come, though we ſhould grant the Doctrine of the Saints Reigning upon the Earth.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:107613:34"/>
                  <p>In utmoſt extremity, to violate property for the preſervation of life, is no theft, or at leaſt that theft is no ſin; yea it becomes a duty: For no man can be neceſſarily placed between two evils: The one of them will be a duty.</p>
                  <p>Since the fall of Man, Property is neceſſary to avoid confuſion, which the luſts of men would introduce: yet perhaps it is not ſo determinate and ſevere as ſome men imagine. The poor have an intereſt in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the rich, they have a part; which yet theſe ought to give, not the other to take: If they do not give it, they are the thieves. For detaining a right is thievery, as well as taking any thing away wrongfully. I cannot deny but that every thief is covetous, but I do alſo affirm, that every covetous man is a thief.</p>
                  <p>If we could ſuppoſe the ſons of Men free from all ſelf-interest, and worldly love, there would be no need of property; neither would there be any poor: for there is enough in the World to ſerve all men that live in it, if they would be content with a due way of living. But God having (it may be for the hardneſs of mens hearts) eſtabliſht a Property, and National Laws having determin'd it, To ſteal is to prefer the World before Righteouſneſs and Order; whether poor men ſteal bread, or great men ſteal Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord grant, that I may never reckon my ſelf to have any more, but the uſe of things, leſt I rob thee (for in true ſpeaking, thine is the Property) nor ever deny ſo much of theſe things as I can ſpare, to them that ſtand in need of them, leſt I rob the poor; from whom to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, is as thieviſh as to take away!</hi>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXXII.</hi> Of Defrauding.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>DEfrauding</hi> is a deceiving, either by words or actions; and both theſe are either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>pious</hi> fraud; whether that which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts talk ſo much of, be it or no, I ſuſpect whether that of <hi>Jehu</hi> were ſuch, I know not. There is enough in both of them to make them <hi>frauds;</hi> but whether there be enough in either to make them pious, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell.</p>
                  <p>But St. <hi>Paul</hi> being wiſe, caught the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with guil, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 16. This was doubtleſs pious <hi>fraud:</hi> This always deſigns the Glory of God, and the good of the perſon deceived, and does not uſe ill means to accompliſh the end; which indeed a man cannot do, and deſign the glory of God: for the glorifying of God, is our conformity to his Will and Laws.</p>
                  <p>I have always doubted whether <hi>Jacobs</hi> deceiving of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> in the matter of the Bleſſing, were pious or no; however ſince the Scripture paſſes it over in ſilence, ſo will I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bad frauds</hi> alſo are either in words or actions. And ſo they are committed in repreſenting things otherwiſe than they are, whereby our ſelves are advantaged and another is damnify'd; in extravagant commendations, undue diſparagements, in falſe reckonings, falſe weights and meaſures. Yea, if the buyer for ſelf-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, undervalue a commodity, crying it is naught, it is naught, as far as in him lyes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauds the ſeller; as well as the ſeller out of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, magnifying a thing that he knows to be naught, either cheats, or proclaims that he would cheat the buyer, if he could.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:107613:35"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Fraud brought a perpetual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage upon them, though (ſaving what direct lies there might be in it) I cannot ſee much of an impious Fraud in them; no more than (I doubt) the greateſt part of Nominal Chriſtians would adventure upon, if they were in the ſame circumſtances, and were ſure of the ſame ſucceſs. And it is plain that Men in War, uſe Stratagems to deceive their Enemies, and are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; yea, I remember ſome inſtances of this in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, approved by the Lord of Hoſts: although for my own part, without a Revelation, I would judge <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Godly Sincerity</hi> to be the beſt Policy.</p>
                  <p>The impious defrauding, is in ſome ſenſe worſe than ſtealing; at leaſt in this, that it offers a greater abuſe to my Brother. If I ſteal from my Neighbor, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt his <hi>Will;</hi> but if I cheat or deceive him, I abuſe his <hi>Underſtanding:</hi> wherefore moſt Men had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Hen were ſtolen from them, than be cheated of an Egg; and it commonly grates more upon Men to be accounted <hi>Fools,</hi> than <hi>Knaves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly the impoſing upon a Man's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that to his hurt, and my own gain, is very diſingenuous. If he that <hi>calls</hi> his Brother <hi>Fool,</hi> be in ſo much danger; what of him, that <hi>makes</hi> him ſo? Every Man that defrauds, impoſes upon his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's underſtanding, and makes his Brother a Fool. If <hi>Moſes</hi> had indeed put out the eyes of the Twelve Tribes, as ſome of them falſly inſinuated, and had made himſelf altogether a Prince over them, he had better juſtified their murmurings againſt him, than any of thoſe things did, that I read they objected againſt him.</p>

                  <p>ALthough it ſhould not prove ſucceſsful, and that thereby Men do happen not to deceive; yet to Lye, with a reſpect to worldly gain, is a Predominant Love of the World; for it is a preferring of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the World before Truth, and God is Truth.</p>
                  <p>They that maintain any known erroneous Opinion or Practice, onely to maintain a Party, a Name, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the World, are Lyars, and Lovers of the World. Truth ought to be dearer to us than our Lives, much more than Liberty, Eſtimation, or Intereſt. And oh would to God, that ſome of the greateſt Pretenders to Religion, of one way or of another, would thoroughly examine themſelves here! I am very jealous, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny palpable Errors are defended, and many plain Truths are diſſembled and balk'd, or at leaſt many doubtful Things impos'd for Truth, meerly in favor of worldly Intereſt, and that by many that carry their heads very high, and to very pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
                  <p>It is confeſt indeed, that all Truth is not ſo weighty, as to be profeſt, to the loſs of Life; but all Truth is ſo precious, (ſo much as St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Cloak, and Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he left at <hi>Troas</hi>) as not to be denied, no not for the preſervation of Life.</p>

                  <p>THere are two things eſpecially that hurt the wiſe, and ſpoil their wiſdom, <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Bribes</hi> put together, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 7. Oppreſſion makes men mad, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107613:36"/> fretful, and ſo to depart from their wiſdom: Gifts blind their eyes, and make them fooliſh in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; theſe muſt needs therefore be great Evils. It is ſtrange, that giving ſhould do men as much miſchief as taking away; and yet ſo it is, both alike ſpoil mens wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>The very threating of Oppreſſion made ten Tribes in twelve ſo mad, that they turn'd Rebels, and made a defection from <hi>Rehoboam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Oppreſſion is properly found in the Rich, ſuch as Kings and Law-givers. The Law is ſo far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing Oppreſſion, that the greateſt Oppreſſion in the world is done by Law. The greateſt Oppreſſion that ever was committed in the ſight of the Sun, (nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Sun hid his face, as being aſham'd to ſee it) was juſtify'd by a Law; <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye,</hi> John 19. 7. And we do elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where read of great Oppreſſors, that fram'd miſchief by a Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94 20. Landlords oppreſs in Rents, Maſters in Work; yea, any man may oppreſs, that has but ſo much as an Horſe to ride on, in preferring world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Advantage before Righteouſneſs and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>A Man may be an Oppreſſor, in an undue, ſevere, cruel Exaction of that which is his own. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Goſpel that caſt his Fellow-ſervant into Priſon, who was willing to pay, but at preſent could not, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 29.) was a notorious Oppreſſor. And indeed, the moſt monſtrous Oppreſſion of all, is, when the Poor oppreſſeth the Poor; they who feel the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves, and conſequently ſhould pity others; they who are not able to make reſtitution, as the Rich can.</p>
                  <p>It is one of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Aphoriſms, <hi>He that oppreſſeth the Poor, reproacheth his Maker;</hi> that is, either God who made him after his own Image, or God who made
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107613:37"/> him poor; for even Poverty it ſelf may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Gift of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. As if he ſhould ſay, Shall he be reproached or wronged, whom the Maſter of the Family has employ'd in the meaneſt Offices of the Family? It is not the Servants Fault that he is ſo mean; if any man reproaches, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches not ſo much him, as his Maſter. The Foot cannot help it, that it is not the Head. Moſt Men are poor of God's making; but if any make themſelves poor, it is not for any Man to oppreſs them, nor for every Man to reproach them neither: For Reproach is a ſort of puniſhment, which every Man may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of Oppreſſion; in Goods, in Money, (as they that detain the hire of the Labourer) in racking of Rents, in ſelling (making Men pay the more for their Neceſſity) in Rights, in Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome of which I ſhall have occaſion to meditate of hereafter, and therefore will diſmiſs them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>

                  <p>THey that take Gifts to pervert Juſtice, or favor any Cauſe in Judgment, are Lovers of the World: for they prefer it before Truth and Righteouſneſs. I do not think that every Preſent is a Bribe; but I think, it is ſafeſt for a Miniſter of Juſtice, not to take Gifts at all, leſt he ſhould be corrupted.</p>
                  <p>There is certainly a wonderful power in Gifts, to blind the eyes, even of the wiſe, <hi>Exod. 23. 8. Every man</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>is a Friend to him that giveth Gifts:</hi> which argues the great intereſt that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107613:37"/> how hard and noble a thing it is to be purged of worldly Love.</p>
                  <p>Giving is indeed Noble; <hi>Beatius est dare, quam accipere;</hi> Giving to the Poor is a God-like Act; but either to give or receive Gifts for the perverting of Juſtice, is abominable.</p>
                  <p>Bribery, in this reſpect, is generally a greater ſin than ſtealing; in that ſtealing is moſtly committed by men that have need, and Bribery, commonly, by them that have none: The leſſer the Temptation, the greater the ſin.</p>
                  <p>Bribery may be committed in many things beſides money; the Bottle and the Bag do ſpeak as corrupt Language, as the Purſe.</p>
                  <p>And there are many kinds of indirect Bribery <hi>per alium,</hi> as bad as that which is direct and <hi>per ſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a kind of Bribery in Eccleſiaſticks, that hunt after popular acceptance; and Chaplains that preach pleaſing things, or ſtifle Doctrines that they know will be unpleaſing (however edifying) to gain Preferment: which, if the Law would allow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, might, perhaps, more properly, be called Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, than Bribery.</p>
                  <p>Yea, there is a ſtrange kind of blaſphemous Bribery that men uſe towards God. I doubt the greateſt part of worſhip in the world is intentional Bribery. Some go about to bribe God with their Prayers and Faſtings, and Forms of Devotion, ſome with their Alms and Acts of Charity; as they of old did with their Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Sacrifices, of whom the Satyriſt ſpeaks witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</p>
                  <q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Illorum lachrymae mentitaque munera praeſtant</l>

                  <p>Nay, it is to be feared, that however precious a Doctrine <hi>Faith</hi> is, there are many, that under the Notion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, do indeed go about to bribe the Juſtice of God with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; as indeed all thoſe do, who lay great ſtreſs upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and themſelves take no care to be Righteous: Although our Apoſtle hath ſo plainly told us, <hi>That he that worketh righteouſneſs is righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is alſo a great deal of <hi>Political</hi> Bribery in the world; when Councellors, Senators, or other Truſtees, betray that Sacred thing their <hi>Trust,</hi> for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or moneys worth.

                  <p>I Will now conſider of <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due deſire of <hi>worldly wealth.</hi> This deſire is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, by the <hi>kind</hi> of the <hi>wealth,</hi> or by the <hi>degree</hi> of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107613:40"/> 
                     <hi>deſire:</hi> And ſo we are covetous, either when we luſt after that which is <hi>another mans,</hi> or intemperately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>worldly wealth of our own,</hi> though we uſe no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe, is that Covetouſneſs directly aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in the Tenth Commandment, called in <hi>Greek</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and it is a ſort of invading of another Mans Right.</p>
                  <p>There is a good Covetouſneſs, a coveting earneſtly the beſt Gifts; but this improperly called Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For to ſpeak properly, we are not to covet the Gifts and Graces that are in other men, although in themſelves they are covetable; yet as they are other mens, they are not the object of our deſires. There may be a bad deſire of a good thing.</p>
                  <p>Evil Covetouſneſs is of earthly things, and it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes an impotent and worldly mind, and an over-high valuation of earthly things; it argues us to be led by our Senſes, and not by right Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>This Covetouſneſs is a kind of ſpiritual <hi>Adultery:</hi> Not only he that looks upon his Neighbors Wife, but he that looks upon his Neighbors Houſe, or Land, or Goods, to covet them, is guilty of worldly Love, and that is ſpiritual Adultery: A ſin little regarded, I doubt, but certainly very dreadful.</p>
                  <p>The firſt unchaſte glances of the Eye towards any thing that is our Neighbors, is forbidden; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to be offended at them, to make haſte to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, to repent of them: But if we allow them to grow up into wilful and ſteddy deſires, they are that predominant Love of the World that the Apoſtle tells us is ſo pernicious.</p>
                  <p>See what ſevere notice God takes of this kind of Covetouſneſs; how he viſited it in <hi>Eve,</hi> who coveted an evil Covetouſneſs to her Poſterity; in <hi>Achan</hi> and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107613:41"/> 
                     <hi>Ahab,</hi> who coveted an evil Covetouſneſs to their own Houſes.</p>
                  <p>There is no Man that is over-greedy of having, but will ſometimes deſire to have what is none of his own. If this be the ſtanding Maxim, <hi>Oportet habere, We muſt have;</hi> it will follow, <hi>Unde habeat quaerit nemo, It is no matter how he comes by it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They deceive themſelves, that excuſe their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, by ſaying, <hi>I covet nothing of yours, I deſire nothing but mine own.</hi> This cannot be, every world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded man is guilty of this Covetouſneſs; for the ſame nature and principle that prompts men ſo greedily to gripe their own, will certainly put them upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to finger other mens.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Covetouſneſs has a great deal of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in it, it is a kind of ſtealing. He that luſts after a Woman, is a Whoremaſter; he that hates his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a Murderer; and by a parity of reaſon, he that covets, is a Thief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, who knows how oft he is guilty in one degree or other! Help me to make a Covenant with my eyes, leſt they betray me in looking upon my Neighbor's Houſe, as well as his Wife!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be Covetouſneſs, in too vehement deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of what is another mans, though one be willing to give a ſufficient price for it. I do not think it will excuſe <hi>Ahab</hi> from Covetouſneſs, that he offered a full price, or a good exchange for <hi>Naboth's</hi> Vineyard. Nay, the very over-buying of a thing, (if it be judicious) is an argument of Covetouſneſs; if ſome preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or unſeen convenience do not excuſe it. And what can one make of them that cry, <hi>I wiſh ſuch a thing were mine to beſtow upon you;</hi> or, <hi>I wiſh it were mine ſo, that no body were the worſe for it:</hi> What, I ſay, can any man make of theſe, but Fools and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To heal us of this Diſeaſe, let us learn not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value earthly things. They are all lovely onely in God. In him we may enjoy the ſweetneſs of all theſe things, without poſſeſſing the things themſelves; ſo far as we are ſpiritualiz'd; we live upon God, and enjoy all things in him, and cannot be covetous.</hi>

                     <hi>The ſin of</hi> Eve <hi>was, that ſhe coveted to be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in his incommunicable Properties: If ſhe had been omniſcient as God, then God had not been omniſcient; for there cannot be two Omniſcietns.

                  <p>AN immoderate greedy deſire of worldly Things, though not attended with another mans hurt or loſs, is Covetouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>To ſeek an unwieldy greatneſs and fulneſs in the world, to extend ones care to Childrens Childrens Children; what does this ſpeak, but an over-high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation of the world, and an atheiſtical diſtruſt of God?</p>
                  <p>To be more ſtudious of worldly Accommodations, than of enriching the mind with virtue; of gaming an Eſtate, than of ſaving the Soul; of Portions for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, more than of their Education; is palpable prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the World before God, and rank Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>And what excuſe can be made for thoſe greedy Tradeſmen, that appoint to themſelves no end, no meaſure of getting? I know indeed that an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is good; and I know alſo, that there are many good ways of mens employing themſelves, beſides ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107613:42"/> for Riches. I doubt theſe men do never ſincerely examine themſelves, whether all this while, in all theſe pains that they take, they act out of pure Conſcience to live in an Employment. Methinks it is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the temper of univerſal Charity, to ſay, <hi>Now that I have provided for my own houſe, when ſhall my Brethren provide for their houſes alſo; I will make room for thoſe that are ſtraitned; I have eaten and drunken, now let them alſo eat and drink.</hi> Or if pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of an Employment keep them in their ſtation, that they will ſtill work with their hands the things which they account good, let it be to give to him that needeth.</p>
                  <p>Much wealth neceſſarily brings along with it much care, many fears doth uſually increaſe, worldly deſires will be followed with great accompts: And to prefer this before the peace and quietneſs of our minds, and the eaſineſs and paſſableneſs of our accompts, ſavors of great imprudence, and, I doubt, impiety.</p>
                  <p>I know Covetouſneſs is hard to be diſcerned, and it is of ſo ill a name that few will own it. But the Searcher of hearts does diſcern it; and his Word does deſcribe the men that are guilty of it, by their haſtening to be rich, by lading themſelves with thick clay, by their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be rich, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.) by their riſing up ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, late taking reſt, eating the bread of ſorrows, and the like. And we can partly diſcern mens neceſſities, their Families, and their Dependents; if their worldly care exceed what theſe do in reaſon call for, it is to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that it is degenerated into Covetouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>To theſe intemperate Gapers after wealth, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that plain, but terrible Text of our Lords, <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> What a ſtrange task is this! Yea, though we ſhould
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107613:42"/> be ſo favourable as to interpret it of a Cable Rope, which yet the ſpelling of the word will not endure. A Camel go thorow the Eye of a Needle? It implies the greateſt humane impoſſibility.</p>
                  <p>Oh but (ſays the Worldling) God can effect this; for the Text tells us for our comfort, <hi>That with him all things are poſſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I pray Friend, <hi>How know you that God will? Is it not that God, who hath commanded you not to covet, not to labour after the meat that periſheth, not to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what to eat and to drink, not to ſeek great things for your ſelves, not to lay up treaſures for your ſelves on earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh but they can come off at leaſt by diſtinguiſhing: By <hi>rich</hi> men are there meant, <hi>Thoſe that trust inriches.</hi> Now, <hi>ſay they,</hi> we can avoid that well enough.</p>
                  <p>Nay, not ſo eaſily neither. If it were ſo eaſie a thing, <hi>What need rich men be charged ſo ſeveraly that they do not trust in riches?</hi> It ſeems rather to be very difficult, next to impoſſible; in that Chriſt hath made having Riches, and truſting in Riches, to be Phraſes of the ſame importance, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 23, 24. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture records thoſe few that were rich and good, as wonders of Divine Grace, as inſtances of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: And indeed there are but very few of them. He paſt for a Prodigy of old, <hi>Quiſquis ingentes oculo irretorto ſpectat acervos;</hi> and ſo he may do now.</p>
                  <p>It is the Character of a Diſciple of Chriſt, <hi>To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Houſe and Lands for his Name ſake.</hi> And is this an Argument of a mind ſo diſpos'd, a ſign of a Soul ſo prepar'd, to be perpetually graſping after more, and to be joining Houſe to Houſe, and Land to Land?</p>
                  <p>If they that hunger after <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> are therefore <hi>bleſſed,</hi> becauſe <hi>they ſhall be filled,</hi> I am ſure they muſt

                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh the ſhame that is upon the Profeſſors of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Christ Jeſus! Men that pretend to a life more excellent than a Prince his, to be guilty of Covetouſneſs. All their Religion is in vain, who mind earthly things.

                  <p>I Will deſcend a little lower, to conſider of <hi>Worldly Carefulneſs.</hi> This is directly contrary to Faith in the Promiſes and Providence of God, and ſo is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the World before him.</p>
                  <p>It proceeds from a diſtruſt of God's Providence, which diſtruſt is very ſinful and diſhonourable; nay, it is as if one ſhould refuſe to take God's Word for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſecurity. However light men make of it, and however ſmall a fault the Worldling repreſents it to himſelf, ſure I am, our Saviour links it with Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, and ſeems to make it as bad a fault and as dangerous as they, (Luke 21. 34.) <hi>Take heed lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting or drunkenneſs, or cares of this life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It argues a want of ingenuous affiance in God, and is perplexing to the mind, hindring converſe with God, which is the higheſt perfection, and the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Souls of men.</p>
                  <p>What can I ſay worſe of it, than that it is unſeemly, uneaſie, unſafe, and unprofitable? For after all our Cares, all Events depend upon God; and all humane Solicitude cannot ſtate or ſix one Event, nor make the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107613:43"/> leaſt change in the courſe of things, <hi>not one hair white or black.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not remember that ever I heard Chriſt Jeſus more induſtrious in arguing againſt any thing, than againſt this <hi>worldly Carefulneſs,</hi> Mat. 6. Read the Goſpel throughout, and I do not think you will find him to have ſet himſelf more againſt any ſin than this.</p>
                  <p>Our heavenly Father is very gracious in offering his help for our relief againſt this <hi>Carefulneſs. The Curſe be upon me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Rebekah</hi> to her ſon <hi>Jacob.</hi> Kind mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!

                  <p>Diligence is not this <hi>Carefulneſs; Care</hi> is not ſo much forbidden us as <hi>Carefulneſs.</hi> This ſolicitouſneſs about the World is known to be ſinful, by the unſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, the immoderateneſs of it; when men take more care, and beat their brains much more about the things of the Body, than of the Soul; of Time, than of Eternity.</p>

                     <hi>DIſcontent</hi> is the Souls Tumultuation or Mutiny: In Civil Affairs, Mutiny is accounted a degree of Treaſon; and it is no leſs in Spirituals.</p>
                  <p>A reſtleſneſs and unſatisfiedneſs of mind with our preſent condition, is a preferring of our own wills, or our own eaſe and accommedation, before the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>This I diſtinguiſh from Impatience, in that Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience always ſuppoſes Evils; but <hi>Diſcontent</hi> may be in plentiful and good condition.</p>
                  <p>When this <hi>Diſcontent</hi> is predominant, it argues a worldly temper, a Soul too much affected towards worldly things, and an unſubduedneſs to the Will of God; it argues, I ſay, <hi>Pride and Unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In general, it is an admirable temper to ſeek rather nothing. If we have enough, we ought not to deſire more: for by the ſame Rule, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſtill more than that, and yet more, and no meaſure will be put to our deſires.</p>
                  <p>But it will be asked, <hi>What is enough?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is a very hard Queſtion to anſwer. It is not theſame to all: yet there is ſuch a <hi>quantum,</hi> as enough,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107613:44"/> in the World. To the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were enough, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8.

Let us contemplate the <hi>Holy Jeſus,</hi> and conſider what he accounted enough. It is moſt certain, that he might have had more, therefore his was no contentment upon force; ſo far as can be gather'd from his ſtory, a ſmall pittance in the World was enough to him.</p>
                  <p>I know it may be reply'd, <hi>Christ had no Children to provide for.</hi>

Will it certainly be the better for them to be left Rich? I am ſure it proves worſt to many; a Fuel to Vice, and that is worſt. Poor means Children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prove the beſt; not only the beſt Men, but the beſt Scholars, the beſt Artiſts. To marry Children richly, is not the way to make them better, but prouder, and idler. The beſt proviſion for Children, is Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the beſt matching them, is the uniting of their Souls to God.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſay to thoſe that covet for they know not whom; that have neither Child nor Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet are not ſatisfi'd with riches, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 8. If this be not rank vanity, I know not what is.</p>

                  <p>This, I doubt, is but a pretence, and a meer fallacy.

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XLIII.</hi> Of Immoderate Mourning, or Impatience.</head>
                  <p>IMmoderate Sorrow for the want or loſs of worldly things, ſprings from an intemperate love of the World. It is certainly a preferring of worldly things, before the Will and Wiſdom of God: Here by we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, reſiſt it; we would deſtroy it if we could, and ſet up our own wills in its ſtead.</p>
                  <p>It is very fooliſh too: For if we bind up our hearts in worldly thing, and they happen to flie away, they carry away our hearts too, and leave us dead and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted.</p>
                  <p>It worketh death ſometimes in the <hi>plainest</hi> ſenſe; men go down into the Grave by mourning: but in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe certainly. It is fatal and damnable, if predominant</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:107613:45"/>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſt, that many good People have had Fits, Paſſions of this; but this will not juſtifie, it was unſeemly in them; let us beware that that be not predominant and habitual in us, which in them was only a violence, a ſudden Fit or Paſſion, which they ſubdu'd preſently, and ever repented of.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Impatience</hi> of Evils is very unreaſonable. <hi>Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and not evil? Who am I, poor, proud, ſinful Wretch, that I ſhould fanſie my ſelf to be ſuch a Darling of Heaven, that it ſhould not ſo much as ſuffer the cold Air to breathe upon me? Shall I be glad to receive the good which I have not deſerved, and be angry to bear the evil that I have?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is unreaſonable upon God's account too. The degree and duration of all ſickneſs is weighed out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly by an infinitely wiſe mind: The Cup that is given us to drink is mingled, and preſented by our heavenly Father. Moreover, this wiſe God is infinitely kind too; <hi>He doth not willingly afflict, nor delight to grieve the children of men,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. He would not afflict them, but for ſome good that he hath in view.</p>
                  <p>When we pray, <hi>That the Will of God may be done,</hi> it ſeems we mean his will of kindneſs onely: Lord, we are willing that thou ſhouldſt bleſs us, and do us as much good as may be; but nothing of thy afflicting Will, oh No: Or if that muſt be done, let it be done upon others, not upon us. Oh rarely diſtinguiſht; as if we ſhould ſay, Our Father, we deſire that thy Will may be done and executed univerſally; but yet with this limitation and reſtriction, that it do not croſs our wills at any time. Or will we underſtand our Prayers ſo, as that all men ſhould be ready to do the Will of God, but not that God ſhould do his own Will? Rare Divinity!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh but my impatience and immoderate mourning over
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107613:46"/> loſſes of Eſtate, Relations, Health, doth not proceed from any over-valuation of them, but from the ſenſe of God's diſpleaſure, he afflicts me for my ſin; this Providence is a judgment, a puniſhment; and may I not, ought I not to lay it to heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You believe ſo; and therefore you infer, that it is reaſonable to be impatient: You do well, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to be angry, and intemperate. And I pray, why ſhould we not be content that God ſhould puniſh us for our faults? Ought we not to ſubmit to the Diſcipline of our heavenly Father, as well as to the Parents of our fleſh? It is hard to ſay when God puniſhes his Children for their faults; but be ſure however, that it is for their amendment. And to be impatient, that we are corrected for our faults, is an ill kind of Repentance, it adds faults to faults.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good God, mold my will into thy holy Will! Thou art fatherly and friendly in thy Corrections; rather ſmite me, than not recover me; rather make up my way with thorns, than ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THere are many ſorts of Uncharitableneſs, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am conſidering of the riches of the world, I will confine my ſelf to that of not giving alms.</p>
                  <p>Not to give at all, and to have bowels perfectly ſhut up againſt the indigent, is the groſſeſt uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs: So groſs, that I thing few are guilty of it, and none will confeſs it.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:107613:46"/>
                  <p>To give ſomething, but grudgingly, and with an ill will, is uncharitableneſs: not to take pleaſure in this exerciſe, ſpoyls it. Men may be many ways forc'd to give, and yet no thanks to them; it does not proceed from a charitable mind.</p>
                  <p>To give ſparingly, is uncharitableneſs: Not that true charity conſiſts in the quantity, but in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: The Goſpel-widow gave much in giving her mite. But not to give proportionably to what God hath given us, and the neceſſities of our families will permit, is uncharitableneſs. Nay I ſuppoſe that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true charity requires, that a man do ſometimes defalk from himſelf, and ſtraiten his own family in ſome degree, to relieve the neceſſities of others.</p>
                  <p>If any one would know the juſt proportions of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I confeſs I do not find them preciſely ſtated in the Word of God, neither do I take it to be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a charitable mind to be curious in this enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; I ſuſpect them that are, as I do thoſe, who labour much to know the loweſt degree of ſaving grace. To theſe that ask, How much more muſt we give? I will not anſwer as our Saviour did in ſomewhat a like caſe, If you will be perfect, <hi>Go ſell all, and give to the poor;</hi> but I will deſire them ſeriouſly to conſider of the proportion which God expreſly requir'd the Iſraelites to give to the Levites and to the poor; and of that tenth part, which it is reported that Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and many other charitable perſons, have thought themſelves bound to devote to charitable uſes; and then onely add with our Saviour, <hi>Go thou and do likewiſe.</hi> But it is againſt the nature of charity to be ſtinted: I think therefore if we liv'd by this ſhort rule at preſent, it might do well, to give what we can ſpare, and to ſpare what is more than enough. When I and my Family have fed well on a diſh of meat, I do not grudg
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107613:47"/> to give the reſt to the poor. And ſo I argue, when I have enough for my ſelf and mine, the reſt belongs to the poor. And would to God men would know when they have enough of riches, as they do, when they have eat and drunk ſufficiently!</p>
                  <p>To give that which is another mans is not Charity; or at leaſt it is an ill govern'd Charity, that is not in Conjunction with Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O thou that takeſt pleaſure in the communications of thy ſelf, that gloryeſt in the raying; forth of thy own Perfections, who rejoyceſt in thy works of Bounty and Merey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conform me alſo to this divine diſpoſition, that I may rejoyce to do good; account it a better and bleſſeder thing to give than to receive; be better pleas'd to find an object, upon whom to beſtow a treaſure, than to find one! And let this rejoycing be pure; not ſpringing from the hopes of a reward (leſt my very charity at laſt ſhould be found to be covetouſneſs,) nor from applauſe in this world (leſt it ſhould be pride) but from a principle of God-like Love, Chriſt-like Compaſſion, and rational belief, that in is better to give to them that need, than to keep what one needs not!</hi>

                  <p>THe general notion of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is a Gratification of any Faculty; or a Satisfaction reſulting from the union of the Faculty with the Object. From whence it follows, that there muſt needs be the greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the enjoyment of God; eſpecially when all the Faculties ſhall be advanced and inlarg'd.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:107613:47"/>
                  <p>It is not harſh to ſay, nor (methinks) hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that Mans chiefeſt happineſs conſiſts in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for the happineſs wherein Man takes no pleaſure is not happineſs: Heaven it ſelf cannot make a mind happy that cannot delight in it.</p>
                  <p>It is lawful to take pleaſure in the things which we poſſeſs. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeems to make it an argument of a worldly mind not to do ſo; ſure I am, a man may do ſo, and yet not be ſenſuallly Voluptuous. It is ſtrange that covetous Men, who love the World moſt, ſhould yet find the leaſt pleaſure in it; they can take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in what they have, for graſping after what they have not.</p>
                  <p>Covetouſneſs ſeems to be more unnatural than Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs. Innocent Nature aims at the Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſelf, even in the Creatures that have not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. To enjoy preſent good things, and not to lay up in Barns, is the commendation of Birds, the moral vertue of Sparrows.</p>
                  <p>Yea Pleaſure ſeems not only to be lawful, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: Life would not be Life without it. If there were not a thing call'd <hi>Enjoyment,</hi> as well as <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> the ſilly Bird, that makes her Neſt where ſhe pleaſes, would be as rich as the greateſt Landlord. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that nature ſhould take pleaſure in the ſupply of her wants, in the gratification of her appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. Pleaſure is as natural to ſenſitive Creatures, as Appetite, and Appetite as Being.</p>
                  <p>But however natural the Pleaſures of Senſe are, there is a mighty difference between the pleaſures of Minds and Spirits. The pleaſures of the Fleſh laſt no longer than whilſt the neceſſities of nature are in ſupplying; enjoy them and you loſe them. The pleaſures of the Spirit are fine and ſtrong, and (like it ſelf) laſting, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, <hi>Pleaſures for evermore.</hi>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XLVI.</hi> Of Worldly Pleaſure.</head>
                  <p>THere have been of old, and it is propheſy'd that there ſhall be hereafter, Men that love Pleaſures more than God: Whoever theſe Senſualiſts are, the love of God is not in them. For the predominant love of Senſual Pleaſures is inconſiſtent with the ſaving Love of God: If the Belly be our God, our end will be deſtruction; God ſhall deſtroy both it and us. If we ſerve our own Bellies, we ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; whom if any man ſerve not, love not, he is <hi>anathema-maranatha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The predominant love of pleaſures is deadly; <hi>if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye:</hi> Yea, it is death it ſelf. What the Apoſtle ſays of every Widow that liveth in pleaſure, true of every Woman, yea, and Man too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>They are dead whil'st they live,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 6. This was the Father's opinion of his voluptuous, prodigal Son, during his riotous courſe of life, <hi>he was dead,</hi> Luke 15. 24.</p>
                  <p>To take more pleaſure in the gratification of the bodily ſenſes, than of the Soul, What is this, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Beaſt above the Man? To give up ones ſelf to the pleaſures of the fleſh, more than of the mind; to prefer them before the enjoyment of God, before the exerciſe of Virtue, is <hi>to be lover of pleaſures, more than of God,</hi> and conſequently to be the Lover of the World here ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>I know it is hard to convince a man that he is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually intemperate in his Pleaſures: But certainly, when men do induſtrionſly, from time to time, purſue their pleaſures, and that in things unlawful, theſe muſt needs be the pleaſures of ſin, and this is manifeſt ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107613:48"/> Yea, though it be not in things directly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, if the purſuit be with more zeal and induſtry, and more expence of time, than the intereſt and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the Soul, it muſt needs be accounted Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and a living after the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>When every particular man has purg'd himſelf, (as the worſt of men will do) and deny'd the charge of being Senſualiſts; yet it remains a certain truth, that <hi>there are many lovers of pleaſure, more than of God; ſuch as live in pleaſures upon earth,</hi> as the Apoſtle phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 5. not lap and away, as a Dog at <hi>Nilus;</hi> but they wallow in them, they ſwim in them, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſe themſelves in them, they delight in them as in their proper Element: Such as <hi>love pleaſures,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 17. Such as are <hi>given to pleaſures,</hi> as the Prophet deſcribes them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 8. Such as <hi>ſerve divers pleaſures,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3. Such as <hi>fare deliciouſly every day,</hi> as it is ſtory'd of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-glutton: Such, as like Beaſts, nouriſh their hearts as in a day of ſlaughter. Theſe, ſure, are predominant Lovers of pleaſure: And are there not many ſuch now, as well as there were in the days of thoſe Prophets and Apoſtles? Let us not miſtake; a man may ſin in his pleaſures, who does not take pleaſure in ſin.</p>
                  <p>Carnal pleaſures I reckon to be either ſenſual, or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical. Thus I will diſtinguiſh them for method ſake: Although thoſe of the Fancy may, for ought I know, be properly enough called ſenſual. I think Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines reckon them ſo; and Fancy it ſelf may well be call'd a bodily ſenſe, being found in Beaſts as well as men.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe ſenſual pleaſures become <hi>unlawful,</hi> either by their <hi>Matter, Meaſure, Manner,</hi> or <hi>Seaſon.</hi> And in this order I will addreſs my <hi>Meditations</hi> to them, and afterwards conſider of the pleaſures of Fancy.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt the ſenſual Pleaſures that are unlawful in the very matter, <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> offer themſelves eſpecially to be conſider'd. To prefer theſe pleaſures of the fleſh, and gratifications of the Beſtial Appetite before Purity, is a predominant love of the World.</p>
                  <p>Whil'ſt we carry about with us ſuch Bodies as theſe, we ſhall have an appetite to Conjunction, as well as to Eating or Drinking; which to think perfectly and properly to mortifie, (for I do not call <hi>Reſtraint,</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification) ſeems to be ſomewhat like the Fanatical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, <hi>Of living without Meat.</hi> The Luſt of Hunger is beſt mortifi'd, by being duly gratifi'd: and perhaps the beſt, if not onely way of ſubduing this Appetite, is to accommodate it, in the ways and ſeaſons allow'd by the God of Nature; and ſhall no more be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a making proviſion for the fleſh, <hi>to fulfil it in the luſts thereof,</hi> than Brewing or Baking, the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent kind of Cookery.</p>
                  <p>Who can blame the Philoſopher that would eat, though for no delight he took in the meat, yet to be rid of the importunity of hunger, which ſolicited him and weary'd him ſo, that he could not follow his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and was glad when the trouble of eating was over. <hi>Dare operam liberis</hi> is but a toil; and ſuch an one as a wiſe man, is afterwards aſham'd that he has taken. To find no need, and to have no appetite, in this caſe, (as indeed in moſt others) is more eaſie and pleaſant to a good and wiſe man, than to have relief and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For my own part, if I were put to my choice, I would much rather chuſe, never to be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107613:49"/> hungry or thirſty, than to eat and drink at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>But however natural this appetite is, God has founded it, and determin'd it to its Object. Eating is a natural Action, and to hunger is a natural Luſt; yet ſome Meats we know were forbidden, ſo are ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions.</p>
                  <p>As the Caſe now ſtands with Man, I think Marriage is a merciful Inſtitution, and much for Man's eaſe: It is better to be ſtinted here, than left at liberty; as it is better for a Traveller to be bound up to one ſafe way, than to have many ways to chuſe at.</p>
                  <p>And as it is a merciful Inſtitution, becauſe it avoids Perplexity; ſo becauſe it eſcapes Superfluity: <hi>Fruſtra fit per plures,</hi> &amp;c. One Woman is ſufficient for one Man; which makes <hi>Adultery</hi> more inexcuſable in the Males, than in the Females.</p>
                  <p>Marriage is alſo very much for order. What a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Confuſion would there be in the World, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Copulation were allow'd! Yea, even thoſe more than brutiſh Epicures, who will plead for it to be allow'd to themſelves, do not allow it to their Horſes and Dogs. For they that would keep up a right ſtrain, and a generous Breed, will not ſuffer the Female to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender with every Male that has a mind of her.</p>
                  <p>Marriage, and the juſt obſervation of the Marriage Covenant, is alſo for the health of Men; whereas <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> bring Diſeaſes, filthy and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diſeaſes upon the Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And who can ſufficiently bewail the defilement of the Land? Alas! that ſo many Families in one City, of the moſt Reformed Nation upon Earth, ſhould be maintain'd by the curing of Diſeaſes, brought by ſuch ſins, as the better ſort of the Heathens abominated, and ought not to be once nam'd amongst us as becometh Chriſtians!</hi>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XLVIII.</hi> Of Gluttony and Drunkenneſs.</head>
                  <p>NExt to the ſenſual Pleaſures that are unlawful in the <hi>Matter,</hi> come to be conſider'd thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in the <hi>Meaſure.</hi> The <hi>Matter</hi> of the pleaſure in eating and drinking, is lawful; but the <hi>Meaſure</hi> makes them both no pleaſure and ſinful too. Whoſoever takes pleaſure in meat or drink more than in God, is a lover of the World.</p>
                  <p>For the gratification of the ſenſual Appetite, to eat or drink things forbidden, was to prefer the ſervice of Senſe, before the Authority of God; ſince the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of meats and drinks taken away, to eat, though it be Honey; and to drink, though it be Wine, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, is the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But this Exceſs is not ſimply to be eſtimated by the quantity: Some men may and ought to eat and drink more than others, and in ſo doing are not exceſſive, becauſe Nature is but well relieved in theſe by ſuch a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107613:50"/> 
                     <hi>quantum,</hi> which in others would be oppreſt. It is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical and Unchriſtian, to judge another man by my proportion. He that ſhould appoint the ſame meaſure of Manure to feed, or deſire the ſame meaſure of Rain to refreſh all ſorts of ground, and ſhould make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> would forfeit his skill in Husbandry. Yea, though a thirſty Traveller or Labourer, or an unwary <hi>Noah</hi> ſhould chance to be drunk with a draught of Wine, he would be innocent, in compariſon of the Sitter, who yet can wipe his mouth, and go home, and ſay, <hi>He is not drunk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much leſs is Exceſs to be eſtimated by the diſtemper conſequent upon eating and drinking. Many men are Gluttons, that do not ſurfeit; and Drunkards, that are not drunk. The ſober and temperate are ſometimes diſtemper'd with that <hi>quantum,</hi> which the intemperate are not affected with. Many can ſit by the Wine from morning till night, and not be inflam'd; and yet if a very good call do not juſtifie them, a Woe may belong to them for all that, and they may be reckon'd amongſt the Drunkards.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, it requires much skill in Phyſick, as well as in Divinity, to know exactly how not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in eating or drinking: And certainly if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfect Caſuiſts concerning our ſelves, much leſs can we be concerning other men. Such is the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Body, that perhaps few men go to Bed not unduly affected, in ſome kind or degree or other, with meat or drink. Let wiſe men judge, whether they be altogether ſo wiſe and well at night, as they were faſting. By that time we have well thought how ſmall a miſtake either in the kind, or meaſure, or ſeaſon of meat and drink, may in ſome degree offend, we ſhall have reaſon to ſubſcribe to the Proverbial
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107613:51"/> Aphoriſm, <hi>Anima ſicca eſt ſapientiſſima.</hi> But yet there are ſuch ſins as Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, and they are Symptoms of a Worldly mind, and they are to be judg'd by the predominant inclination and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>
                  <p>The preference of the meat and drink that periſheth, before that which endureth to Everlaſting Life, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates a Carnal Man (if not in proper ſpeaking, a Glutton or Drunkard) Chriſt himſelf being judge. I know it is not ſpoken againſt Senſuality, but Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and yet it may indifferently be apply'd to either, that taking thought what to eat and to drink, does make us to ſymbolize winh Heathens, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 31, 32.</p>
                  <p>To be ſtudious for the Palate, to pamper and indulge the appetite, to make proviſion for the fleſh, <hi>to fare Sumptuouſly every day,</hi> to mind the gratification of the Senſes, more than the ſervice of God, the publick good, the relief of the poor, the nouriſhment of the Soul, is a gluttonous, at leaſt a ſenſual way of living.</p>
                  <p>To follow after ſtrong drink, to provoke to intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate drinking, to be mighty to drink and to exerciſe that might, to ſtrive to drink down others, to drink for wagers or victory, to prefer a drinking life before buſineſs and uſefulneſs, is ſenſual, and a kind of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs too, though it neither ſtammer nor ſtagger.</p>
                  <p>What then? are we limited in eating and drinking to a bit or a ſup; as in ſpeaking to yea and nay? Lord, what man upon earth ſo wiſe as to know, ſo exact as to obſerve ſuch a point!</p>
                  <p>Surely there is an innocent entertainment; as well as a neceſſary relief of nature: But what Caſuiſt ſhall ſtate it? Any degree of eating or drinking that fits us for higher offices ſeems to be lawful.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:107613:51"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, I beſeech thee grant that my appetite may be allways ſubject to my will, my will to my reaſon, my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to thy Holy Word! Grant that I may not take undue pleaſure in Wine, wherein is exceſs; but be filled with thy Holy Spirit! That I may not ſerve my own will or luſt in eating or in drinking, but make it my meat and drink to do thywill! That I may by a divine Communion continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally eat the Fleſh and drink the Blood of the Son of God; in which there is no danger of ſurfeiting! Oh there let me inſatiably hunger and thirſt!</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To eat and drink is in it ſelf innocent, and a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral innocent delight may be reaped from thence: but to reliſh and ſenſate theſe innocent pleaſures, only as they are natural gratifications, is groſs and ſenſual.</p>
                  <p>The moſt refined Souls whilſt they are in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctian with theſe Earthly bodies, muſt needs find plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in what gratifies the natural Appetite: But they find more pleaſure than ſo, pleaſure of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beſides that.</p>
                  <p>The Soul ought to taſt the ſweetneſs of God as well as the palate relliſh the created ſweetneſs of meat and drink; it ought to behold the amiableneſs of God as well as the eye behold and admire any created beauty.</p>
                  <p>If we do not riſe up by the particular created good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the creature, to the uncreated goodneſs, the Father of Lights, we are groſs and ſenſual.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107613:52"/> How groſs are the Amoretto's of the World, who ſtand gazing upon the ſweet Features and charming Complexion (forſooth) of a Miſtreſs; the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, who dote upon the Fabrick of a Houſe, or the Shape of a Horſe, and contemplate nothing higher!</p>
                  <p>How can I commend the convenience of Riches, the refreſhingneſs of Meat and Drink, the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sleep, the ſweetneſs of Friends, or of Life, and not climb up to Riches, Refreſhment, Reſt, Love, Life it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>That whereby any thing is in any kind excellent, is ſome communication from God, ſomething of and from him. Why then ſtand we gazing and doting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beautiful Objects? Why ſo raviſh'd with melodious Ditties? Can we not contemplate Harmony in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract; nor Beauty, exeept it be incarnate? Can we enjoy nothing, but what we can ſee or hear, or handle? O dull and degenerate Souls!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O thou most bleſſed and eternal Spirit, refine and ſpiritualize my apprehenſions and ſenſations; that I may ſee thee in every thing that I ſee, taſte thee in every diſh and draught!

There may be a time when the very pleaſant praiſes of the Lord may ſeem unpleaſant, and the Songs of <hi>Sion</hi> be out of Tune. The Apoſtle, by his disjunctive diſcourſe, ſeems to imply ſome ſuch thing, concerning the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Pſalmody, that it is not ſeaſonable in a time of affliction; <hi>If any be afflicted, let him pray: If any be merry, let him ſing Pſalms.</hi>

                  <p>But to lead a merry jocund Life, to give up ones ſelf to Eating and Drinking, and Sports, in a time when God calls to Weeping and Mourning, is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a prophane and profligate Senſualiſt, and ſeems to be an unpardonable preſumption. <hi>Iſa. 22. 14.

                     <hi>Lord, how like is the new World to the old one! But ſhall there not yet be newer, wherein dwells righteouſneſs? why there then ſhall be pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were.</hi>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. LI.</hi> Of Fantaſtical Pleaſures.</head>
                  <p>THere are pleaſures of the Fancy; which may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from the Pleaſures of the Senſes, though Divines uſe to confound them. To prefer theſe before God, is to be a predominant lover of the World.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſin, that I know of, but may be acted over in the Fancy, and affect the body no further.</p>
                  <p>A mental dalliance with a Miſtreſs, though it gets no Baſtards, yet is Adultery, and prefers the World before Chaſtity and Purity. The vigour of the Fancy both prevents and ſurvives bodily uncleanneſs: There are earlier and later Adulteries in Fancy, than in Senſes. <hi>Inceſtos amores a tenero meditatur ungui,</hi> ſays the Poet: And Fancy acts over again the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to which the Body is inſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Covetouſneſs is acted, yea mainly acted in the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Oh the full Bags and Barns, the large Fields, the Mountains of Gold that are to be found in a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Fancy, Sure theſe men who fancy ſuch great things to themſelves, and delight in ſuch Fancies, are they whom the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>whoſe heart goeth after their Covetouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pride is acted mainly upon the Stage of Fancy; though ſomtimes it breaks forth into words, as in <hi>Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> yet ſometimes it never goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Fancy, and yet is mortal and damnable; as ſeems to have been the caſe of <hi>Herod,</hi> whoſe Fancy was pleaſed with the blaſphemous acclamations of the people, <hi>and he gave not glory to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſtractions and ſtrange rovings of Fancy, after odd impertinent things, in a careleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent manner, is a great corruption. And to give
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107613:54"/> the reins to a roving deſultory Fancy, without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reduce and reclaim it, is a predominant Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. Methinks that even to think nonſenſe for an hour together, ſhould ſhame a wiſe Man, what can any man think of thoſe men that are more ſolicitous to reclaim the wild ranging of their dogs, than of their fancies, but that the beaſtial part doth predominate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the rational.</p>
                  <p>Who can ſufficiently lament the ſad diſorder of the Fancy, and the evil that it betrays us to? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly and unjuſt is it that our thoughts, which are the firſt-born of our Souls, ſhould be ſo ſquandred away in a wild-gooſe chaſe, much ſillier than childrens purſuing of butterflyes, or following of crows through thick and thin, <hi>teſtaquae lutoquae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O my mind, haſt thou ſo lowly an object, and ſuch important matters to beſtow thy ſelf about as God, and the things of Eternal life; and canſt thou have leaſure to dream away thy time, and ſpend thy powers upon things that are not, that need not be, that never will be? Doſt thou laugh at the Chimerick fictions of Poets, and yet ſpend thy ſtrength in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Doſt thou account it time next to loſt, to read Romances; and yet canſt be at leaſure every day to make them?</p>
                  <p>Lord what a fickle, fluid, ungovernable thing is Mans Fancy! How is this contexture of the body a ſnare to my Soul; diverting, hindring, ſpoyling its operations? Fancy is a neceſſary faculty, without which I can perform no action; and alas how has ſin got into it, and deſiled it, poyſon'd the very fountain?</p>
                  <p>To a Worldy Fancy, I might add alſo a Worldly Memory: For certainly to be able to remember all Worldly Concernments, and ſtill to forget the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Soul, and the World to come, is a ſad
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107613:54"/> Symptom of a worldly mind. But amongſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Pleaſures of the Fancy, I muſt inſiſt a little upon <hi>Revenge,</hi> becauſe it is frequently acted only upon the Stage of Fancy, and does not proceed into Act: And all this while vain men are apt to think themſelves free from it. To this therefore I will now apply my Thoughts.</p>

                  <p>UNder this Head of <hi>Fantaſtical Pleaſures,</hi> I bring in <hi>Revenge,</hi> partly becauſe I do not foreſee any Head that it will be ſo fitly reduc'd to; and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think it is more uſually terminated in the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than other ſins are. If a man be of a proud, luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, covetous Fancy, it is ten to one but he will ſhew it one time or other, in Words, Actions, or Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors, that ſhall be ſignificant: But <hi>Revenge</hi> may be, and I doubt is uſually terminated in the Fancy, for want of power or opportunity to ſhew it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Revengefulneſs</hi> is a temper that does moſt certainly conclude the predominance of the Worldly Nature above the Divine.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, in ſhort, to be nothing elſe, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation or retribution of Injuries either contriv'd or executed; which is a thing ſo difficult and nice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſo much clearneſs of apprehenſion, and purity of mind, that no mortal man may meddle with it: It is beyond all created Skill, and therefore God does challenge and appropriate it to himſelf alone. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows men to ſhare with him in his other Perfections; to imitate his Wiſdom, Mercy, Patience, Juſtice: <hi>But Vengeance is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12. 19. And again, <hi>Vengeance belongeth to me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Heb. 10. 30.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:107613:55"/>
                  <p>It is a great miſtake in men, to imagine that ſo long as they hold their hands, they have committed no Murder, becauſe (forſooth) no one can Indict or Arraign them: For a revengeful temper is Murder; <hi>He that hateth his Brother is a Murderer,</hi> 1 John 3. 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Revenge</hi> does not conſiſt in the doing of miſchief: To deſire it, to contrive it, to meditate with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon it, to rejoice in it if done by any other, is <hi>Revenge:</hi> yea, to ſuſpend neceſſary and uſual kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not to give meat to an Enemy if he hunder; yea, not to love an Enemy, is a degree of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Goſpel excels all Philoſophy, in the Doctrine of <hi>Revenge.</hi> The <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Jews</hi> generally held it no ſin, to do evil to one that had hurt or wronged them: They ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt hate thine Enemy.</hi> But the Goſpel forbids all hatred, even of an Enemy, and conſequently all <hi>Revenge:</hi> For there can be no revengefulneſs, without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of hatred.</p>
                  <p>It is a very ſpiritual and cloſe ſin; it may be, and yet not be diſcerned. It puts on divers ſhapes: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it would be miſtaken for Zeal, as in the caſe of the two Diſciples, <hi>calling for fire from Heaven,</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the mean time <hi>little better than ſet on fire from Hell.</hi> Sometimes it mingles it ſelf with Juſtice: <hi>Bring her forth,</hi> ſaid Judge Judah, <hi>and let her be burnt: Yes, burn her by all means, rather than</hi> Shelah <hi>my youngest Son ſhall marry her, lest he dye as his Brethren dyed.</hi> Yea, ſometimes it would fain paſs for kindneſs, and be interpreted good Nature. Thus the kind King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> gave his daughter <hi>Michal</hi> to Captain <hi>David, to be a ſnare to him:</hi> And the crook-footed Philoſopher very charitably wiſh'd, <hi>His
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107613:55"/> ſhoes might fit the feet of him that had ſtolen them:</hi> So far was he (good man) from <hi>Revenge.</hi> A chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table revengeful man gives his Neighbor the hook.

                  <p>Neither is <hi>Revengefulneſs</hi> the ſin of great men only: A poor man may be as <hi>revengeful,</hi> and take as much pleaſure in fancying and meditating <hi>Revenge,</hi> as the Blades of the World in executing it; who, for a word ſpoke awry, (forſooth) preſently term'd an Affront, muſt have <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>

                  <p>And to the Carnal, whether Rich or Poor, no doubt but <hi>Revenge</hi> is very ſweet; and the Fancy as much tickled and delighted with the ſpeeulation of it, as the bodily Senſes, with any Act of Intemperance or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.

                  <p>I do not think it is ſimply unlawful to go to Law: But if any man go to Law without the leaſt mixture of Uncharitableneſs, or Revengefulneſs, the ſame is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man.

                  <p>Well, I ſee there is no <hi>Revenge</hi> allow'd me towards my Neighbor, and yet there is ſuch a kind of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite in my Nature, I will ſpend it therefore upon its proper Object. Though Self-Murder is the worſt of of Murders, yet Self-Revenge is the beſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges.</p>

                     <hi>Be reveng'd upon thine eyes, O my Soul; not by pulling them out, but by ſhutting them, by bringing them into Covenant. Have thy Senſes betray'd thee? Deny them their liberty in ſome things lawful. Keep under that Body, that has been petulam and troubleſome.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107613:56"/> It was too ſevere Revenge in the Pepiſh Saint, who cut off his right hand that had ſuffered a too affectionate kiſs of a Female: But if thy Senſes abuſe their liberty, retrench them; deny them ſometimes of things lawful, if they will adventure upon things unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Oh bleſſed God, whoſe infinite Purity, impartial Juſtice, all-wiſe Love, do render thee alone fit to take Revenge, and to retaliate thine own injuries and mine too; perfectly mortifie in me this Appetite, and all that Pride and Self-love, that are the fuel of it. And inaſmuch as I ſee it is by no means ſafe that ſuch a Sword be committed into the hands of ſuch a mad fool as I am, help me to commit my Cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, without foreſtalling him, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to him; not determining the way, nor haſtening the time, nor ſo much as deſiring the thing! Oh that I may be able to ſay, I have not deſired the evil day, Lord thou knowest: that I may ſeek the peace of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>though I be a Captive in it; yea, though in her peace I ſhould be no ſharer!</hi>

                  <p>AS a <hi>Species</hi> of Revenge, or at leaſt a Product of a revengeful mind, I may here ſeaſonably medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a <hi>little</hi> upon <hi>Curſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a ſolemn <hi>Curſing,</hi> or delivering up to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, performed by Church-Cenſure; which is a kind of revenging of God's quarrel, a Diſcipline that he himſelf has committed into the hands of Men, which they muſt take heed to uſe for him, not for themſelves. The greateſt thing, for ought I know, that God has committed into the hands of men.</p>
                  <p>This is eaſily, but wretchedly perverted, when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107613:57"/> the Miniſters of it revenge their own Cauſe and Quarrel, ſerve their own intereſt, and not Gods: Gratifie their own Luſts, more than the Will of God; when they had rather that men ſuffer'd, than were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; were damn'd, than amended.</p>
                  <p>There is an Extraordinary and Prophetical <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> proceeding from an extraordinary motion of the Holy Spirit; found only in pure minds, and yet but ſeldom in them neither: Such was <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s curſing the ill-bred Children, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe paſſages of <hi>David</hi> in the Pſalms, I rather take to be a Prophetical Denunciation, than a Curſing of the Wicked. Let us be ſure we know what ſpirit we are of, before we adventure to imitate theſe inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red men.</p>
                  <p>And alas! Why ſhould we curſe the Wicked, who are haſtening to greater Evil than we can wiſh them! Beſides Charity would rather command us to pity them, and pray for them: So did <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> ſo did holy <hi>Stephen,</hi> ſo did St. <hi>Paul</hi> for his Judge <hi>Agrippa;</hi> and his Perſecutors the <hi>Jews,</hi> Acts 26. 29.</p>
                  <p>There is an extraordinary Self-curſing by way of Proteſtation, to be uſed ſparingly, in weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I refer this to extraordinary Swearing.</p>
                  <p>There is a prophane <hi>Curſing.</hi> And this is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary or ordinary, and both ſymptoms of a <hi>worldly mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Extraordinary</hi> prophane Curſing is, when People in cool blood, knowing what they ſay, from a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind, and ſometimes with great ſolemnity of kneeling down, lifting up their hands, putting off the Hat, do imprecate miſchief upon a perſon that has wrong'd them, or offended them. This, when it is done in its Formalities, looks like a Sacrament of the Devil, an Ordinance of Hell, a kind of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſm:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107613:57"/> But a horrible preſumption certainly it is; a preſcribing to Infinite Wiſdom, a taking of Gods Work out of his hands, an uſurpation of Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. Wicked, bold man; How dareſt thou take upon thee the government of the world, and judge any man before his time? Dar'ſt thou imploy the Almighty in a work, wherein he takes no pleaſure; engage Love it ſelf to act againſt his own nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully? To pray God, not to have mercy upon man, is the higheſt blaſphemy: It is as if one ſhould pray him to ceaſe to be God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ordinary</hi> prophane curſing, is either of our ſelves, or others; and each is threefold; upon <hi>ſlight</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon <hi>none</hi> at all, or <hi>worſe</hi> than none.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of <hi>our ſelves:</hi> When men upon every ſlight occaſion, to confirm every inconſiderable truth, which it is no great matter whether it be believed or no, or may as well be confirm'd and believ'd by a bare aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will wiſh they may never ſee the Sun more, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver open their hands more, that the drink might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go through them, the meat might be their poyſon, that they might never ſtir more, might be hang'd, that God would judge them, or that they might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, if ſuch a thing or ſuch a thing, be not ſo, or ſo. This I'm ſure is more than Yea and Nay; it is highly fooliſh, and indeed prophane.</p>
                  <p>Mans knowledge is fallible, his Memory frail, Senſes deceitful: And if this thing ſhould prove other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then thou wicked man, out of thy own mouth thou ſhalt be condemned; <hi>ſo ſhall thy Judgment be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are inſtances of Gods taking ſuch men at their words, but I need not inſiſt upon them. It is an argument that men ſtand not in awe of God, when they dare invocate his Judgments, and challenge his Juſtice.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:107613:58"/>
                  <p>Secondly, But when upon no occaſion at all, to confirm nothing, men will dare God to damn them; oh horrible and impudent impiety! Theſe men have not ſo much mercy for themſelves as the devils: They pray'd that they might not be tormented before their time, theſe pray that they may. Of theſe ſure, if of any unbeleevers, it may be properly ſaid, that they are <hi>condemned already.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is worſe than no occaſion, when men uſe cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſing in deſign, to commend themſelves to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, as an ornament and imbelliſhment of ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of others.
<list>
                        <item>1. When ever and anon, upon every ſmall provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or offence, men will paſſionately call for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veance, lay the Pox or Plague upon others, or it may be ſend men to the devil, upon no other errand, but to tell him, they are making haſt after them.</item>
                        <item>2. When upon no provocation, in no paſſion, but in a familiar jocular way, men curſe one another; nay with the ſame breath, curſe their friend, and ſwear how much they love him.</item>
                        <item>3. It is by ſome reputed a piece of familiarity: You muſt take it as a kindneſs, eſpecially if you be an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that they will be ſo great with you, as to curſe you <hi>Sic ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of prophane curſing inferior to all theſe, a curſing in <hi>Short-hand.</hi> Many men are aſham'd to curſe in words at length, but boggle not to do it in Characters and Abbrevations. If theſe men know the true original of theſe Characters, and the meaning of them, it is all one as if they ſpoke in words at length. If they do not, but yet ſuſpect them, it is bold, it is an adventuring upon an appearance of evil, which is flatly forbidden. Suppoſe they ſuſpect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107613:58"/> of this meaning in theſe common words: If they have no meaning, they are idle words; and that is bad enough. And if they profoſs ſincerely, they know not what they mean, they proclaim themſelves fools, that know not what they ſay. It is a miſerable ſhift to embrace fooliſhneſs and madneſs to avoid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs.</p>
                  <p>But it is to be ſuſpected, that they that mince the matter, do know the meaning of theſe characters well enough; how elſe could they apply them ſo patly, ſo ſeaſonably as they do? One may know they ſtand in ſtead of a curſe, becauſe they come in the order and place of one. When I hear a man ſay a pound on him, or a ſhackle on him, for I am much beholden to him, and he has much befriended me; then I will believe he knows not what he ſays.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to be cleanly and charitable to wiſh men in Heaven, and that God had them: But I have heard it come out of as prophane mouths, and with as ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a deſign, as any curſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bleſſed God, who bleſſeſt us daily; communicate to us of thy gracious nature, that we alſo may bleſs and not curſe! let us never preſume to reckon our ſelves a part of Chriſts purchaſe, till we find our ſelves actually redeemed from our vain converſation received by tradition from our fathers!</hi>

                  <p>I do premiſe, (which every body (ſure) knows) that we are to value our ſelves by our Souls, not by our Bodies, or ſecular Concernments: And to prefer the Body before the Soul, is all one as to prefer the World before God. For that certainly is moſt to be loved and preferred, that makes moſt for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul in a Chriſt-like Nature. He that thinks himſelf too good ſo much as to be laught at, or ſpoken ill of, is a very ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Captain of our Salvation valued Subjection to the Will of God, and Charity for the Souls of men, before <hi>Senſual Eaſe:</hi> when theſe came in competition,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107613:60"/> he accounted him a <hi>Devil,</hi> who cry'd, <hi>Maſter ſpare thy ſelf.</hi> It was indeed in his power to have ſpared himſelf; but he was an hardy Captain, and would not ſave himſelf, rather than betray us.</p>
                  <p>It is true, Nature deſires Eaſe from Adverſity; the Soul has a wonderful Sympathy with, and Kindneſs for the Body: But thoſe ſoft and delicate perſons that cannot endure that the fleſh, or any fleſhly intereſt ſhould ſmart, though it be the Will of the Sovereign Wiſe God, though this Plaiſter might work a Cure, though Affliction might bring forth the pleaſant fruits of Righteouſneſs, are ſtrangely immur'd in fleſh, and ſunk into Senſe.</p>

                  <p>UNder this Head of <hi>Eaſefulneſs,</hi> I may ſeaſonably meditate of <hi>Fear of Sickneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I cannot deny, but that <hi>Sickneſs</hi> is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the Senſes, yea, I think I may confeſs, that the Soul cannot but ſympathize with the Body: for there is a ſtrange and unaccountable dearneſs which ſprings from their conjunction.</p>
                  <p>But yet the Soul hath an health belonging to it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Body, called in Scripture, <hi>The ſpirit of a ſound mind.</hi> The Souls <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Eucraſie</hi> lies in Subjection to the Will of God; ſhe ought to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue her own Eaſe more than that of the Body, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Patience before Health or Recovery.</p>
                  <p>We know that Patience is Divine, and that Health is but a worldly good; and alſo that that may be wholſom to the Soul, which is grievous to the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>So that to be afraid of, and to ſtand in awe of <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is a preferring of carnal Eaſe before ſpiritual,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107613:61"/> and before the Will of God: and to be more ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for recovery, than for a ſanctification and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, is ſenſual.</p>
                  <p>Much more then, to flie to undue means for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a manifeſt preferring of the worldly fleſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, before God and his Holy Authority.</p>

                  <p>ANother thing grievous to the Senſual Life, is the death of Friends, and beloved Relations. This, I foreſee, will fall under a following Meditation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will but lightly touch upon it here, although a fair opportunity be given for it.</p>
                  <p>It is the part of a delicate ſenſual Soul, a Lover of the World, to fear the removal of his deareſt Friend, to prefer their Lives and Companies before the Will of God, and its being done.</p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:107613:62"/>
                  <p>I do willingly grant that Friends and Relations are to be loved and delighted in: yea, I think of all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Pleaſures, this is the moſt innocent, and the leaſt beaſtly, (though ſome Beaſts are very fond of their Relations, and others are great lovers of Society;) and good men have been more apt to fall into Fits of this Senſuality, than any other that I can think of. Any one that reads the Story of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>Adonijah,</hi> will be apt to think ſo.

                  <p>Yet as Relations are to be loved onely in God, ſo they are readily to be quitted and forſaken for him, or at his command. His Will ought to be dearer to us, than their company.</p>
                  <p>Many are ſo fond of their Children, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to look off them: They contemplate them by day, dream of them by night. This love, as great as it ſeems to be, is not perfect: for it hath fear in it, and this fear hath torment.</p>
                  <p>I will not here ſay how evil this Love is, but I am ſure theſe People are ill prepared, <hi>to forſake Children for Chriſt's ſake.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Perſecution</hi> is a Croſs that every faithful Diſciple of Chriſt muſt be ready to take up, when ever his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter calls him to it. Holy <hi>Paul</hi> was ready to take it up, in the whole weight of it, <hi>Not only to be bound at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>but to dye for the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> took it up: They might have eſcap'd <hi>Perſecution,</hi> by denying Chriſt; but they were not ſo neſh, although they were but young Chriſtians: They would not accept of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame is the predominant temper of all the genuine Diſciples of Chriſt, <hi>Whoſoever will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Houſe and Lands for my ſake, is not worthy of me.</hi>

                  <p>It is very obſervable how faithful worldly men are to their worldly deſigns and <hi>Dalilahs.</hi> What pains does the mammoniſt voluntarily take; what diſeaſes and dangers does the ſenſualiſt run upon; what perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions does the ambitious expoſe himſelf to? Theſe all take up their croſs and follow their <hi>Dalilah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At what a chargeable and coſtly rate do giddy opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioniſts maintain error and humor, at the price of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation and impriſonment and baniſhment. And will not the ſervants of Wrath be at as much charges for her? Are the children of this World not only wiſer, but kinder than the children of Light. Surely, if we were the children of wiſdom, we ſhould juſtify her, ſtand for her to the laſt drop of ſweat, yea and of blood too.</p>
                  <p>I know no reaſon indeed nor revelation for the courting of perſecution. But inaſmuch as it muſt be the lot of all that will be godly, in one kind or degree or other, it is good to get our minds poſſeſt with it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for it, reconcil'd to it; that when it comes, we may not flye from the Serpent, but take him by the tail, and he will turn into a rod in our hand.</p>
                  <p>If there be any excellency in Righteouſneſs, any thing deſirable in Bleſſedneſs, then ſure there is ſome good, at leaſt eventually, in perſecution; for they are near akin, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> Mat. 5. 10.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is an Honor which is not Worldly, a Praiſe that is of God, and not of man. This renders men, yea the meaneſt and obſcureſt of men, honourable, the excellent of the earth. And to be ambitious of it, is an agument of a truly heroick, and exalted mind; I mean to deſire to be a Son or a Daughter of God.</p>
                  <p>An immoderate affectation of Worldly Honour, is Pride: And to prefer it before innocence, to ſeek it, glory in it, maintain it, rather than truth and a good conſcience, makes a lover of the World.</p>
                  <p>To have a right ſenſe of ones own worth in any kind, is not <hi>Pride,</hi> but <hi>Juſtice.</hi> It is no man perfection to be deceived, nor his duty to think wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>But there is leſs fear of this, leſs danger in it, than there is of an overweening.</p>
                  <p>To expect a juſt eſtimation is but juſt, and modeſt enough, nay ſometimes laudable: for it may be very ſerviceable and may make a man ſeviceable. So that every man may well be allow'd to be tender of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                  <p>But yet patiently to bear diſgrace, and not to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107613:65"/> ſtomach a diſappointment, is generous, and to go through bad report is Chriſt-like.</p>
                  <p>To require, and exact a reverent behaviour from inferiours is juſt; though oftentimes they that ſtand moſt ſeverely upon it, miſs of it moſt: reſpect being ſuch a kind of thing, as often flyes from him that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it, and follows him that flyes from it.</p>
                  <p>There are many objects of Pride, ſuch as Birth, Wit and Learning, and Standing, Strength and Power and Victory, Riches, Intereſt, a Party and the Propagation of it, Children, Beauty, Priviledges, Apparel, yea even Vertuous Actions: To glory in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe unduly, is Pride, and denominates <hi>a lover of the World.</hi>

                  <p>GOds glorifying himſelf is not ſuch a thing, as vain mans ſeeking to make himſelf great by carnal means. It is in ſhort, The raying forth of his own Perfections, the diſplaying of Himſelf, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of his own Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>Mens glorifying of God is not a fancying or ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much of the glory of God: But it ſuſtains a double notion.</p>
                  <p>The leſs proper notion, is the exalting of the Name and Honour of God, aſcribing all good to him, owning him as the Fountain of all. So we glorifie him in the reverend thoughts that we have of him, in making honourable mention of him, dedicating things to his uſe and ſervice. In this Senſe, Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs, and Unbelief are diſhonours to God; as alſo all taking his Name in vain, ſwearing, ſpending all upon our luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>TO prefer the applauſe of men before the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, is to prefer a great Name before a good Conſcience; and conſequently the World before God; the good word of the World, before the good will of our heavenly Father.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to act ſincerely in any thing, and to do that which is right and good, if we intemperately ſeek or thirſt after the applauſe of men, if we love the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God: forths
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107613:66"/> will corrupt the judgment, diſpenſe with things that are ſins as if they were none, and divert the mind from truth and rectitude. When <hi>Saul</hi> had more mind to humor the People, than to approve himſelf to God as his Executioner of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> we ſee how it perverted his adminiſtration, and cauſed him to ſpare that which God had bann'd.</p>
                  <p>Men are incompetent Judges: They cannot diſcern the heart, nor the integrity of it.</p>
                  <p>And the approbation of men is at beſt but <hi>ſilly,</hi> and not fit for any wiſe man to eſtimate himſelf by: Alas! What profits it, it makes no man the better man; yea, it often hinders them from being ſo good as they might.</p>
                  <p>Oftentimes it is <hi>falſe:</hi> For thoſe things that are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed in the ſight of men, are abominable before God.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. LXV.</hi> Of Pride in Beauty.</head>
                  <p>THat Pride in Beauty does denominate a Lover of the World, I ſuppoſe no Body will deny: But the great Inquiry will be, Who they are that are proud of it?</p>
                  <p>I will venture to anſwer Negatively:</p>
                  <p>Not they that pray for perfect, healthful, comely Children.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:107613:68"/>
                  <p>Nor they that eſteem a comely proportion, and juſt ſymmetry of parts, an ornament, and a bleſſing of God.</p>
                  <p>Nor they that endeavour moderately and juſtly to rectifie Deformities, to preſerve Beauty, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeak Affirmatively: All that prefer Beauty before Vertue, Modeſty, Chaſtity, and eſteem it higher than theſe, either in <hi>themſelves</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> are Lovers of the World.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that prefer it in <hi>themſelves,</hi> are ſuch as ſeek the beautifying, adorning, and recommending of the Body, more than the adorning of the mind with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or the life with good manners.</p>
                  <p>Such as uſe undue means to recommend Beauty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too coſtly, or too gariſh, or ſpend exceſſive time in ſetting it off, more than in dreſſing the inward man.</p>
                  <p>Such as ſet off Beauty for ſinful and carna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And what do many fair Ladies do, but play the Whores with themſelves, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Uncleanneſs with their own Faces; who ſtand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing from hour to hour in their Glaſſes, and cannot be got from them, no more than <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Narciſſus</hi> from the Fountain.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that prefer it in <hi>others,</hi> are ſuch as eſteem a fair Woman, before a diſcreet; an handſom, before an honeſt.</p>
                  <p>The faireſt Souls do not always inhabit the fineſt Bodies: <hi>Ingenium Galbae male habitabat.</hi> The beſt Gueſts are not always lodg'd in the beſt Rooms. What a deform'd, luſtful, murderous, ambitious, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious

                  <p>FRom the body I deſcend to the cloths: By which to value ones ſelf, is the meaneſt and moſt paltry ſort of Pride that can be. He that values himſelf by his Body, values himſelf by ſomething that is part of himſelf; but he that values himſelf by his Cloths, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues himſelf by a mean thing, that is perfectly extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to him and nothing at all a kin to him:</p>
                  <p>But the enquiry is, What is this Pride in Apparrel?</p>
                  <p>Negatively, It is not to wear good Cloths, nor handſome ones, nor faſhionable ones, nor coſtly ones, ſuitable to ones quality and eſtate.</p>

                  <p>But there may be as great a piece of pride as any of theſe, in an affected plainneſs and meanneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionableneſs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107613:70"/> of Apparel. To deſign that men ſhould eſtimate our humility by this, is as proud a part, as the Phariſees deſiring to recommend their worth and learning by their long robes: To put on plain cloth inſtead of humility is deceitful, a bad exchange, ſomewhat like an image with a pillow of goats hair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men may go in Sheeps clothing, plain and homely; and yet be inwardly as proud as Peacocks. This ſeems to be a worſe pride than the former, becauſe it adds hypocriſy. What wiſe or good man, can value him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by that, wherein many Rogues, and Whores, yea and Heathen, yea and Birds and Beaſts, and Flowers, do match and excel him?</p>
                  <p>To make gay Apparel ſtand inſtead of true noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and braveneſs of mind, or homely Apparel inſtead of true humility of mind, is a proud ſuperſtition, only beſeeming worldly minds: A deceitful kind of <hi>Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> in manners, putting the ſign for the thing ſignifi'd.</p>
                  <p>To affect bravery in Apparel, for the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of beauty, or oſtentation of riches, is a mean, and oftentimes a deceitful policy. Plain beauties are the lovelieſt to uncorrupted eyes: and exceſſive finery ſerves rather to make people poor, than to prove them rich.</p>

                  <p>To depend upon the Proviſion that by them is made for Old-age, more than upon the Providence and Promiſes of God is carnal and prophane.

                  <p>UNderſtanding and knowledge may juſtly (I think) challenge to it ſelf the place of the higheſt natural Perfection.</p>
                  <p>But to glory in Knowledge and Learning, more than in God that gives them, and more than in the end for which they ſerve, will denominate a Lover of the World.</p>
                  <p>They are proud of their Wit and Learning, who aſcribe their Wit to themſelves, their Learning to their own ſtudy, ingenuity and induſtry, and not to the bleſſing of God. If <hi>Herod</hi> had in a ſober ſenſe ſaid of his eloquent Oration, <hi>It is the Eloquence of God, and not of man,</hi> he had ſaid true; but to ſuffer the People to ſay ſo, in a baſe flattery, and to make himſelf the God, was proud and atheiſtical.</p>
                  <p>They that will not ſubmit their wiſdom to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, that will believe nothing, but what their reaſons can fathom; the wiſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and Diſputers of this World.</p>
                  <p>They that uſe their Wit and Learning to maintain Error, to juſtifie Falſhood; eſpecially they that are learned to diſpute againſt God, and wiſe to prate againſt Wiſdom it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is very much to the diſparagement of Learning, and may ſerve for the humbling of the Learned, that oftentimes the beſt Artiſts are the worſt men, and ſo ſometimes are the greateſt Clerks.</p>
                  <p>However, It is certain that Wiſdom and Learning are as dear to the Animal Life, as the Divine; yea, and that the Devil himſelf is as good a Scholar as the beſt of us all.</p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:107613:72"/>
                  <p>To this Head may be reduc'd a Generation of Fools, who although they do not excel; nor indeed match their Neighbors in Art or Learning, do yet glory in their ſtanding, and in the advantage that they have had to know more than others, though they know not ſo much. Theſe think to conciliate Authority to their Diſcourſe, not by its ſtrength, but their own ſtanding; not by their being <hi>wiſer,</hi> but <hi>ſenior</hi> than other men. <hi>Cieero</hi> jeers his Son <hi>Mark,</hi> that he was of a Years ſtanding under <hi>Cratippus,</hi> and that at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and yet was not a good Philoſopher: How much more ſhameful is it for them who are of 20 or 40 Years ſtanding in the Univerſity, to be inferior in Learning to many that were never there. To think to make our ſelves or our Diſcourſes ſeem wiſer or weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, meerly by reaſon of our Age or Education, is a moſt pedant piece of Pride. As old Age is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe honourable, than as it is found in a way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; ſo neither is ſtanding, otherwiſe than in conjunction with a proportionable underſtanding.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. LXIX.</hi> Of Pride in Riches.</head>
                  <p>COnference and Affiance is one <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Pride in Riches; but this I met with fitly under another Head, therefore I will think no more of it here.</p>
                  <p>To be content with what we have, is no piece of Pride in it ſelf: Though he was a proud Worldling, <hi>who bid his heart be merry, becauſe he had Goods laid up for many years:</hi> Yet it was a good ſaying of a bad Man, <hi>I have enough, my Brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may indeed be Pride in refuſing Preſents; but it is not ſimply a piece of Pride, no, nor Folly neither, to refuſe them. <hi>Balaam</hi> was proud enough; but I do
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107613:72"/> not take it to be any part of his Pride, to refuſe the Preferments offered him by the King of <hi>Moab.</hi> Who dare cenſure <hi>Abraham</hi> of Pride, though he ſpeaks much like a Gentleman to the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 14. 23. and ſwore <hi>that he would not take from a thread to a ſhoe-latchet, lest he ſhould ſay, I have made</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>rich?</hi> Or <hi>Eliſha</hi> either, though a poorer Man than he, who obſtinately refus'd to receive any gift at the hands of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Prince?</p>
                  <p>But to bleſs our ſelves ſecretly in Riches, and think our ſelves better men than our Neighbors, or indeed at all really valuable for them, is Pride, and an undue eſtimation of Riches. And thus I ſuſpect, ſome of the plaineſt and obſcureſt men are the proudeſt.</p>
                  <p>Much more is it Pride to make oſtentation of Riches, either in words by bragging of them; or in deeds, by pompous Buildings, gawdy Apparel, or the like: Yea, poſſibly there may be a proud oftentation even in founding Churches, Hoſpitals, and Alms-houſes. <hi>Come, ſee my Charity</hi> to the Lord and to his Poor, ſounds as ſuſpiciouſly, as, <hi>Come, ſee my Zeal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But of all Oſtentations, it is moſt odiouſly fooliſh, for a Man to bring his Eſtate, as an Argument for his Opinion or Party, or the goodneſs of either: and to bring Riches and worldly Proſperity as an Argument of the ſpecial Love of God, is next to Blaſphemy; as if we thought God to be altogether ſuch an one as our ſelves. From this falſe conceit perhaps it is, that men grown rich from mean beginnings, are moſt apt to be proud; but when they are, they are moſt ridiculous. <hi>This Fellow came in but yeſterday, and he will needs be a Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To aſcribe our Riches to our own care or induſtry, or ingenuity, ſo as to exclude the Providence of God, or not to allow it the higheſt place, is carnal. We know
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107613:73"/> indeed that God gives Riches uſually in a way of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious induſtry, and men of underſtanding uſually have Bread; and to know that God has given us Riches in a way of induſtry, is but juſt.</p>
                  <p>But yet we muſt think withal,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That it was he that gave that ingenuity, and enabled to that induſtry: <hi>It is God,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>that inſtructeth even the Husbandman to diſcretion,</hi> Iſa. 28. 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is not ſuch a neceſſary conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between theſe things and Riches, but that they are often diſappointed; it is the bleſſing of God onely that makes them ſucceſsful, that makes men rich; without which, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So that to aſcribe to our ſelves, and exclude that particular and powerful Providence, is groſs and carnal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, What have I, but what I have received? Thou art the great Houſe-keeper, that givest to all the Members of thy Family their ſeveral Portions, to one more, to another leſs; and which of them may boast over another, or how dare any of them boast against thee? And why ſhould I glory in a thing that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick to me, a ſeparable Adjunct, that may be, and yet I be never the better; or may not be, and I be never the worſe? Nay, in a thing that many enjoy, and yet are really very contemptible and hateful, whom I my ſelf do not think ever the better for them? And why ſhould we admire and value our ſelves for thoſe things, for which we do not value other men?</hi>

                  <p>They are proud of their ſtrength, who glory in it diſtinct from the Almighty; that glory in it, as if they had girded themſelves with ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>That make oſtentation of their ſtrength in words, as the <hi>Philiſtine Braggadochio</hi> did: or in deeds, uſing the utmoſt ſtrength for accompliſhing a ſmall matter; as if a King ſhould raiſe a mighty Army of Horſe and Foot to hunt Flies, or catch Partridges.</p>
                  <p>To make Laws about trivial matters, more for oſtentation of ones Authority, than for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any thing that is really good, is ridiculous, and an abuſe of power.</p>
                  <p>To eat, or drink, or fight for Wagers; to get one anothers money, or to make others ſport, is ſomething worſe than what a Beaſt would do; it approaches to the barbarous Cuſtom of the Heathen <hi>Roman Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> who kill'd one another, for a paſtime to the People.</p>
                  <p>To abuſe Power to Oppreſſion, is like the Lyon in the Fable; <hi>One part of the Prey is mine, becauſe I am the worthiest; Another is mine, becauſe I took most pains in Hunting; and if ye will not give me the third, try for it who dare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To aſcribe Victory to ones own Arm, to the Arm of Fleſh, is to be proud of ones ſtrength.

                  <p>God requires that our ſtrength be employ'd for him; that it be laid out in maintenance of the Truth, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the weak and helpleſs.</p>
                  <p>He has charged us againſt this wickedneſs expreſly by the Prophet, <hi>Let not the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength,</hi> Jer. 9. 23.</p>
                  <p>And how ridiculous a thing is it, for a man to be proud of that, wherein his Horſe or his Oxe excels him, more than he excels a Child? Is a man mighty to eat, or to drink?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, Strengthen me with Might in my inner man, that I may obtain the Victory over Principalities and Powers; triumph over the powers of Hell and Darkneſs, the Devil, and my Luſts!

                  <p>THere are indeed ſpiritual Priviledges belonging to the Saints, wherein they may well glory; yet ſo, as it be in Chriſt onely, and not in themſelves. Who can but glory in the relation of a Son or Daughter of God, of an Heir of the Kingdom, of an intereſt in all the Promiſes of the Goſpel, of free acceſs unto the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107613:74"/> Throne of Grace, and entertainment there, in an intereſt in the prayers of the Faithful, eſpecially in the interceſſion of the Bleſſed Mediator; Theſe are Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges more noble than the moſt princely; in which no man can rejoice or glory too much, except he can rejoice with a joy greater than unſpeakable.</p>
                  <p>But there are Priviledges in which it is eaſy and uſual to rejoice and glory exceſſively and carnally. I have already inſiſted upon Pride in Parentage and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: That which I fix my thoughts upon here is Church Priviledges, or the Priviledge of being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, as all the Members of the Viſible Church are.</p>
                  <p>I take all that are admitted into the Church, and have taken upon them the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, in oppoſition to Jews and Heathens, to be in Covenant: But to them that are faithful in Covenant, and anſwer the terms of it, to them only it is advantageous to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; to the reſt, an high aggravation of their ſin and condemnation.</p>
                  <p>It is doubtleſs a great mercy to be born within the Pale of the Church, taken into the number of its Members, to ſit under the ſound of the Goſpel; becauſe it is the ordinary means of mens converſion to God, and the road that leads to the Church above. But yet to be within the pale of the Church, and not be of the little flock, to be a member of the Church, and yet a rotten and corrupt one; to be a branch in Chriſt that bringeth forth no fruit, to live under the ſound of the Goſpel, and in the mean time the Goſpel to be no more than an empty ſound to men; How little matter of glory is in all this.</p>
                  <p>And yet, how do the generality of men glory in theſe Priviledges, rather than in the anſwer of a good Conſcience; in a form of Godlineſs, rather than in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107613:75"/> power of it? Theſe are lovers of the World and carnal.</p>
                  <p>How impudently did the Jews glory in their Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Law, the Temple, their Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Sacrifices; when in the mean time, they were Strangers to the Faith and Obedience of <hi>Abraham;</hi> broke and made void the Law; refus'd to make their Souls the Temple of God; were uncircumciſed in heart; deni'd to hearken to Gods voice, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Sacrifice, and more acceptable than the fat of Lambs.</p>
                  <p>And is it not as uſual, is it not as reaſonable, is it not as impudent, to glory in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and yet reject the terms of it; to be proud of being Baptized into the Name of Chriſt, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refuſe to be Baptized into the Spirit of Chriſt? Shall a dog brag of his communion with the Family and his memberſhip, becauſe he lies by the fire as the Children do, or eats part of the ſame Bread that they eat? But who are proud of their Church Priviledges? All that value themſolves and their Chriſtianity by theſe. All that bleſs themſelves in the Font, and in the Altar; whilſt they are not at all waſhed from their ſins, neither know what communion with God in the Spirit, with Chriſt in his Graces, means. Who take up their reſt in theſe, not ſeeing any neceſſity of Regeneration, or thinking the Baptiſmal one to be ſufficient: That brag that they are not excommunicate from the Society of the Saints upon earth, when they ſtand excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate from the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; that make more Reckoning that they are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, than that they are Converts. They are Proteſtants; they underſtand by this no more, but that they are not Papiſts; nor no more by that than they come to Church. And is not this a great matter to be proud of? To Glory in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107613:75"/> this, and reſt here, is notorious Hypocriſie and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, Pity the deluded and miſtaken multitude, who come and ſit before thee as thy People, but their hearts are not with thee; theſe run after their Covetouſneſs, their Pride, their Revenge and Luxury?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is an inſtance of predominant <hi>Self-love,</hi> to ſtand viewing and admiring our own particular <hi>Being,</hi> as ſomething diſtinct from the unbounded Eſſence of God, and independent upon him; or to ſeek its gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification without any reference to the <hi>Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> endeavouring ultimately to accommodate <hi>it</hi> with ſomething, that ſhall no way redound to <hi>him.</hi>

                  <p>To dote upon our own Perfections, as if they were the diſtinct Excellencies of our own Beings, and not Communications from God.</p>
                  <p>To allow that in our ſelves, which we condemn in others of the ſame circumſtances with our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>To love our Lives in oppoſition to, in competition with, in a way of ſeparation from God, I have already conſidered; there is yet ſomewhat higher.</p>
                  <p>A man may be guilty of an unchaſte love of his own Soul, as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> with their <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſought the ſalvation of their own Souls in a corrupt manner: Let no one boggle at the phraſe of ſeeking the ſalvation of their own Souls. For the ſalvation of the Soul, is nothing but the happineſs and perfection of it.</p>

                  <p>This they ſought out of God; and we, if we will excel them, muſt ſeek it in him: They ſought it as the perfection of their own Beings, as ſomething diſtinct from God; we muſt ſeek it as a participation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him.</p>
                  <p>Will it ſeem ſtrange to any to hear it ſaid, That men may be ſelfiſh in ſeeking their own Salvation? How were the <hi>Stoicks?</hi> Why may not a man be ſelfiſh in the undue love of one part of him, as well as of another?</p>
                  <p>To account Salvation nothing elſe, but preſervation from miſery; and to ſeek ſuch a Salvation, is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to the carnal, as to the ſpiritual man.

                  </p>
                  <p>If we take Salvation in the true Goſpel-ſenſe, for the perfecting of the Soul in God; then indeed we cannot ſeek the Salvation of our Souls, more than the Glory of God: But in this falſe Notion of it, which I was juſt now ſpeaking of, we may; the <hi>Stoicks</hi> did, and many do. Take it in a true Goſpel-ſenſe, and it is impoſſible to disjoin the Glory of God, and our own Salvation: The ſtronger the love of God is, the purer is the love of our own Souls. The Salvation of the Soul comprehends its being perfected in Humility, Self-nothingneſs as well as other Graces: As the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Spirits caſt down their Crowns before God, aſcribe

                  </p>
                  <p>To prefer the Relation of Children to us, before their Relation to God, to love our own image more than the Image of God in them, is to make Self the Standard of our Love, and the Creature to truckle to the Creator.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak properly, that Kindneſs and Benignity in Parents, that Dutifulneſs and Obedience in Children, that Faithfulneſs and Sweetneſs in Husbands and Wives, that Tenderneſs and Helpfulneſs in Brothers or Siſters, or any Friends, by which chiefly they are lovely, is of God, is God, and ſo to be lov'd and reliſh'd, And to love them under a diſtinct, limited conſideration, as ours, or as a kin to us, is not ſo pure and ſpiritual as it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, there is nothing ours: For God is the Proprietor, we are only the Poſſeſſors; and why ſhould we be ſo fond of that which is anothers? It looks like a piece of melancholy; as if a man ſhould go into a Jewellers ſhop, and there fondly hug a Jewel which is only ſhew'd him, or put into his hands to judge of the worth of it.

                  </p>
                  <p>And as for Relation, what is it but a Notion? It is ſomething, I know not what, extrinſick to us. And why ſhould I be fond of every man that is call'd by my Name? Or why ſhould any man be proud that he is call'd <hi>Charles,</hi> and is Name-ſake to a great King?</p>

                  <p>It is the Speech of a Jeſuite, <hi>Neminem odit, qui De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um amat;</hi> He that loves God, hates no man.</p>
                  <p>By this Epithete things are commended. The beſt wiſdom, is that which is gentle and loving; and the beſt Valor is kind, and apt to forgive.</p>
                  <p>But it will be asked, <hi>Is every man lovely?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, there is ſomething lovely in every man, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God that Love will delight in. No man is ſo bad, but there may be found ſomething of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, good Manners, good Offices, at ſome time or other: all this is an Emanation from God.</p>
                  <p>If none of this were, yet the Relation wherein man ſtands to God, as a reaſonable Creature, makes him lovely.</p>
                  <p>We love our ſown Corn in Hope, and many other things: Let us love the worſt of men, in hopes that they may be good.</p>

                     <hi>Lord, ſhed abroad this Large, Liberal, Generous Grace into my heart! Enlarge my heart, that it may comprehend all mankind! This is better, than, with</hi> Barzillai, <hi>to entertain a King and his Army; or with</hi> Ahaſuerus, <hi>to keep open houſe for a Kingdom. Thus ſhall I, though I have nothing to give, be as Charitable as the Rich, and more munificent than the Princes of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I charge thee, O my Soul, this day in the preſence of the God, whoſe Name is Love, that thou hate no child of man; and that thou mayſt be ſure not to do it, that thou doſt not ſo much as ſecretly deſpiſe the meaneſt, or ſuſpend good offices towards the worſt, or rejoice in the ſins or ſufferings of the moſt injurious of men.</p>
                  <p>But (alas!) what pity is it that this divine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be depraved, that Love it ſelf ſhould become filthy and unchaſte. Separate man and his perfections from God, and then love him or them diſtinctly, and this love becomes adulterous. For although all men are to be loved in God, and for his ſake, yet no man is to be loved any otherwiſe than ſo.</p>
                  <p>They prefer Man before God, who ſtand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the Excellencies and Perfections of any man, as the accompliſhments of this or that particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not as Beams from the Father of Lights. It is the part of unrefin'd minds to admire diverſity of gifts, and overlook the ſame Spirit. How nobly does the refined Soul live and act, who viewing the Perfections of all men in God the Fountain, enjoys them all as fully and deliciouſly, as if they were his own!</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. LXXVIII.</hi> Of Flattery.</head>
                  <p>THis brings me to think of the foul vice of <hi>Flattery,</hi> which although it be not always an Eſtimation of men (for men often flatter thoſe whom in their hearts they diſeſteem and deſpiſe) yet it would be thought ſo, and is as worldly as the other.</p>
                  <p>An humble behaviour indeed is ornamental; ſoft anſwers are good and uſeful.</p>
                  <p>To approve or commend a good man, or a good action, is ſo far from being ſimply evil, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is duty, and may ſerve good ends.</p>
                  <p>But it requires a great deal of wiſdom. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It eaſily mingles it ſelf with ſomething evil, and is corrupted by Covetouſneſs, Slaviſh fear, or Self-love: Men may moſt ſet off themſelves, and ſtudy to endear themſelves moſt, when they commend other men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is eaſily perverted to ill ends, and may as ſoon make me prouder, as better.</p>
                  <p>Commendation therefore muſt be given Juſtly, Seaſonably, Proportionably, and ſhould be mixt with the remembrance of God, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s was to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon, ver.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Flattery is ſometimes groſs, in words; commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, and calling it by good names; aſſenting to every thing at a venture, or denying without reaſon: Magnifying ſome little thing beyond its deſert, and extenuating ſome foul fault into a meer peccadillo, or unavoidable infirmity.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is more fine and ſubtile, in actions; in a crouching, truckling, over-obſequious behaviour.</p>
                  <p>I need ſay no more of Flattery, than that it is,</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:107613:84"/>
                  <p>Firſt, an argument of a mean and ſlaviſh mind. The truly generous mind that adores truth, knows not how to <hi>give flattering Titles.</hi>

                  <p>To prefer the Buſineſs of this World before God, denominates a predominant Lover of the World.</p>
                  <p>God has indow'd Man with active Principles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning him for Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>To be active, is to be like God, who is life it ſelf. He is not an idle Spectator, enjoying himſelf, and minding nothing elſe; neither doing good nor evil, (as ſome prophane men in the Prophet imagin'd him,) but he is good, and doth good.</p>
                  <p>An idle and unactive life is unmanly and infamous. No ſtation does exempt men from Buſineſs, Gentlemen and Ladies have their Callings: There is Buſineſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to all ſorts of men. Having already of Idleneſs, I will ſay no more of it here, but this, A good man muſt needs love Buſineſs, as it is a Vehicle of Grace: For how can a man exerciſe Righteouſneſs, Mercy or Charity, without Buſineſs?</p>
                  <p>The neceſſities of humane life are ſo many, either our own own or other mens, that it is impoſſible any man ſhould be idle, but who is of an idle, ſenſual temper.</p>
                  <p>To prevent miſtakes, I will firſt conſider what is not to prefer the buſineſs of the World before God.</p>
                  <p>To be diligent and induſtrous in our Callings, with a good deſign, is not it.</p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:107613:85"/>
                  <p>To be more in worldly Buſineſs, than in heavenly, is not it. God himſelf has allow'd ſix dayes to one.</p>
                  <p>To employ our hands in working, more than in lifting up to Heaven, is not worldly. If we ſpeak properly, To obſerve due meaſures, and propound right ends in worldly Buſineſs, is Conformity to the Will of God, and heavenly.</p>
                  <p>God acted like himſelf in the Creation of the world, as well as in the Redemption of it; and ſo do godly men, in employing themſelves about worldly Objects, as well as ſpiritual. The Angels are as well in Heaven when they are employ'd upon Earth, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the goings of the Saints, as in their moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Contemplations.</p>
                  <p>To give the Precedency to worldly Buſineſs, as to Management and Action, is not ſimply, and always it. A leſſer Buſineſs, and more ignoble, may be <hi>prohic &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>To do every thing in its proper ſeaſon, is a point of high Wiſdom, and indeed Religion. Let us always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Religion is in the due management of worldly Buſineſs, as well as otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>To do Works of Neceſſity or Charity on the Lord's day, is not it.</p>
                  <p>To have a reverend eſteem for that day, is good and neceſſary: Religion flouriſhes in a Kingdom, or a Soul, as that is obſerved. But yet there may be a Superſtition in it; which our Saviour, by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Doctrine has endeavor'd to heal.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is better to offer ones ſelf ten times where there is no Need, than to deny Aſſiſtance once where there is.</p>

                  <p>BUT there is a love of worldly Buſineſs, which is intemperate, and a ſymptom of a worldly mind.

                  <p>Some dote too much upon their own worldly Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which yet is materially lawful.

                  <p>Suppoſe Buſineſs to be lawful, yet it muſt alſo be neceſſary, or highly convenient, to juſtifie mens zeal about it. What Neceſſity is there, or Convenience either, that Rich men ſhould be ſtill Richer, or that one man ſhould have all the Trade of a Town?</p>

                  <p>To love to know the Faults of men, is not a good temper; yea, it is painful to a godly mind.</p>
                  <p>To look into the Faults of men, to bring them to puniſhment, may be a good work; it may be done ſincerely, for the execution of ſome good Law that is of moment; it may poſſibly be in mercy to the Offender, and out of pure kindneſs; as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>I love him, therefore I will get him puniſht.</hi>

                  <p>But men are not generally of ſo pure and publick a Spirit: They are ſo revengeful, ſo covetous, that makes the Office of Informers hardly thought of; and it is accounted a fault to be inquiſitive into the faults of other men.

                  <p>But to lay ſnares for the righteous, to watch for their halting, to ſeek occaſions againſt a man in the matter of his God, though a Law would favour, is wicked, and much reſembles that great buſy-body that goes up and down continually ſeeking to devour. <hi>Daniels</hi> accuſers had a Law to juſtify them; yet I doubt not but they were wicked Informers for all that.</p>

                  <p>THere are ſome things in the World that are not properly call'd Buſineſs, which yet to prefer before God, denominates a man worldly; and theſe are the <hi>Faſhions of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot properly call it Pride, Covetouſneſs, or Voluptuouſneſs, to conform to theſe, and yet it is carnal.</p>
                  <p>There are indeed civil and innocent Faſhions of the World, to which to conform, is no Fault; nay, conſidering Man as a Member of Society, ſeems expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
                  <p>Matters of Apparel, ſo far as ones Quality, Eſtate, Health, and other conſiderable circumſtances will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Matters of Salutation, of civil Courteſie and Reſpect, ſeem to be of this ſort. Nay, to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in theſe, eſpecially to place Religion in them, and to make Conſcience of Nonconformity to them, ſeems to be an Argument of Superſtition and Weakneſs, and of a mind not underſtanding its juſt Liberty, or valuing it ſelf by falſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:107613:88"/>
                  <p>But to follow any evil or ſuſpected Mode or Guiſe, becauſe it is a Cuſtom, and Faſhionable, is a faſhioning ones ſelf according to the World, or being conformed to this preſent evil World.</p>
                  <p>To luſt after every new Faſhion, though never ſo coſtly, inconvenient, exotick, and to be catching it up greedily, is an argument of a light mind, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant: yea, and it is a very troubleſom thing, not to be able to keep in a Faſhion, till one be well warm in it.</p>
                  <p>For a free Nation to dote upon the Faſhions of other Nations, ſeems to be ungenerous, and a kind of ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, and to be a cauſe of confuſion; and it is obſerved to be prejudicial to the Trade and Wealth of a Nation.</p>
                  <p>I think I have read of Laws ſomewhere made againſt bringing in of ſtrange Faſhions: At leaſt the Precept of the wiſe Preacher will fairly reach them, <hi>Pro. 24. 21. Meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All following of Faſhions that is in conjunction with Pride, Prodigality, Wantonneſs, and is either the Parent or Child of fleſhly Luſt, is a ſymptom of a worldly mind, and denominates <hi>a Lover of the World:</hi> And to prefer the Faſhions of the World before Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Modeſty, Charity, Humility, or Truth, is <hi>to prefer the World before God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I reſtrain not <hi>Faſhion</hi> to Apparel, but extend it toall matters of Opinion or Converſation.</p>
                  <p>If they be Works of Darkneſs, we are flatly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to have any fellowſhip with them, though they be committed at Noon-day, though they have a general Approbation, or Publick Sanction. If it be an evil, though a multitude have made it a Faſhion, we are not to follow it.</p>
                  <p>Alas! How great a number of People are led whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107613:88"/> by Example: that examine nothing, judge nothing, make no choice of any thing; but live meerly by this Maxim, <hi>To do as the most do;</hi> yea, and that even in things relating to Religion it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt part follow what is moſt Faſhionable, even in the Worſhip of God. It may happen indeed that what is moſt Faſhionable, may be good: But whether it be ſo or no, it matters not to them; for they proceed not by the Goodneſs of the thing, but by the Faſhionableneſs of it: ſo that though it be good, it is no vertue in them that follow it; for if any other way quite different ſhould be in Faſhion, they would follow that too.</p>
                  <p>If we could ſuppoſe a thing purely indifferent, it were no Fault to follow it according as it is uſual or faſhionable: Nay, it would rather ſeem an argument of a proud and quarrelſome mind, not to do it. But I cannot conceive how any thing <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> can be called indifferent: For when Humane Acts are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated, they become prudent or imprudent, comely or uncomely, fit or unfit for their ends, that is, good or evil, all of them.</p>
                  <p>What is the Worſhip of the whole <hi>Vulgus</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but an Apiſh imitation of a received Mode and Faſhion? And it were to be wiſh'd, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> who have a better Worſhip, had generally any better ground for it than they.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, I know that Man is a ſociable Creature, apt to imitate what is exemplified to him, loth to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and alſo that his Soul is now ſo ſunk into his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that he is more prone to follow the ſight of his Eyes, than the light of Reaſon, which thou hast ſet up to guide him.

                     <hi>MEDITAT. LXXXII.</hi> Of Swearing.</head>
                  <p>AMongſt the Faſhions of the World, I cannot but a little think (and yet cannot well endure to think) of <hi>Swearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot well tell to what Head of the Worldly Life to reduce <hi>Swearing,</hi> except it be to the Faſhions of the World. Sure it cannot be the love of Profit, nor of Pleaſure, nor a deſire of Honor, that puts men upon this; and yet it is worldly, and a ſymptom of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane mind.</p>
                  <p>Men do not ordinarily get any thing by <hi>Swearing,</hi> except it be in Caſes of Falſe Swearing, where they ſell their Oaths to ſerve another mans intereſt. This is ſo hateful a Practice, ſo like that of <hi>Judas</hi> (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a ſetting of God himſelf to Sale) that though it ſhould bring in Thirty pieces of Silver, or ſome ſuch ſmall matter, one would think no man ſhould dare to make the Bargain.</p>
                  <p>But the ordinary faſhionable Swearing in common Diſcourſe gets nothing; nor is it with any deſign to get, that I can imagine. Nay, it may reaſonably be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be to mens Loſs: For it very much tends to the weakning of a mans Reputation in the apprehenſion of all ſober men, (with whom it is a Maxim, <hi>That he that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107613:89"/> will ſwear, will lye</hi>) and that is certainly to men Worldly diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>In the common notion of Pleaſure, it cannot be Pleaſant; it relieves no Hunger, quenches no Thirſt, gratifies no Senſe. Nay it is harſh to the Ear, and muſt needs be unpleaſant to the Conſcience, that at any times reflect upon it.</p>
                  <p>It is ſhameful and diſhonourable amongſt all ſober perſons; and conciliates no honour or real reſpect with them that are themſelves addicted to it; being common to the meaneſt and baſeſt of men, as well as to the beſt Gentleman of them all Nay, they that are addicted to this vice, do not ordinarily allow it in their Servants and Children; and ſometimes will not ſeek to tell us ſo.</p>
                  <p>And what, has the Devil found out ſomething that is deviliſh and damning, that is neither Profitable, Pleaſant, nor Honourable? Is it not ſtrange that that Monſter ſhould have any Voluntiers in his ſervice, that will ſerve him without any wages at all; and ſerve him ſo vigorouſly too, as if they would take Hell by ſtorms, and the Kingdom of darkneſs by violence! Oh it is the Faſhion, it is an argument of an agreeable temper, and a mind not hatefully ſqueamiſh.</p>
                  <p>And oh God, How ſhould thy Soul but be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this, that has entertain'd ſuch a Faſhion as this! What pity can poſſibly be ſhewn to ſuch deſperate Wretches, who will needs go to Hell in State, and periſh Modiſhly!</p>
                  <p>And is there no plauſibler Pretence than Faſhion? Yes, ſome think they come off better, that impute it to Paſſion: They were angry, they were affronted, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they could not be believed. In ſhort, ſuch and ſuch things would make any man mad, and who could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Swearing?</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:107613:90"/>
                  <p>Alas what miſerable ſhifts are theſe; to confeſs mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the excuſe of folly; to take Sanctuary in <hi>Scylla,</hi> to eſcape <hi>Carybdis.</hi> Shall violent paſſions be brought to excuſe ſwearing, when themſelves cannot be excus'd? If it be a ſin to ſwear, is it not a greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o ſwear in a mad mood? To be at all poſſeſt with a Devil of Paſſion is ſad and grievous, though it be a dumb Devil: But if it be ſuch a Devil as we read of (<hi>Luk.</hi> 9.) that makes a man cry out, and foame again, it is much more dreadful. Or ſhall we ſay that ſin is leſſened, by being multiply'd; after the manner of a River cut into many Channels? A River ſo cut, will indeed be the leſs River; but it will have never the leſs water, if you take it in all the Channels. If ſwearing in a mad mood and violent paſſion be the leſs ſin, becauſe of the paſſion; yet that part of the ſin which is wanting in the Oath, will be found in the Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Some excuſe the matter by the ſeldomneſs of it: Now and then they rap out an Oath; but it is out of forgetfulneſs, and unawares; yea poſſibly they wipe their mouths with a <hi>God forgive me that I ſhould ſwear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This indeed will excuſe a <hi>tanto,</hi> the ſeldomer the better: But Chriſt Jeſus commands, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> which refers to time, as well as things. This now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and-then-ſwearing is an argument of a mind forgetful of God; which is a Character bad enough. Allow our ſelves in this, and it will ſoon multiply.</p>
                  <p>I wonder men ſhould excuſe themſelves in this ſin by the infrequency of it, more than in others. No body ſays, I ſteal but an Horſe or two in a Year; I play the Whore or the Whoremaſter but twice or thrice a week: yet one would think there were more temptations to either of thoſe, than to Swearing.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:107613:90"/>
                  <p>How many ſoever the faults of good men are, yet I ſuppoſe it is a very rare thing to find a Godly ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a man of true Seriouſneſs, and hearty Religion. That will adventure by this Method, to vent his Paſſion, adorn his Diſcourſe, or humour the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>If by <hi>Seldom,</hi> be meant, that we never ſwear but ſolemnly, in a weighty matter, and ſuch an one too, as cannot otherwiſe be known, or will not be believ'd, accompany'd with a juſt reverence of God, (ſuch as we read of ſometimes in the Hiſtory of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jacob, David,</hi> and in the Writings of St. <hi>Paul</hi>) let ſuch ſwearing paſs for a part of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But raſh and unneceſſary ſwearing though it be never ſo ſeldom, proceeds from the Devil, ſays our Saviour; and leads to him, ſays his Apoſtle (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12.) and therefore I may ſafely ſay is a prefering of the World before God. If it be by the Creator, it is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; if by the Creature, idolatrous.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in mind of another excuſe for ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they only ſwear ſome petty Oath; no blaſphemy, no bloody Oaths, as they call them.</p>
                  <p>But I hope theſe petty Oaths are more, than <hi>yea</hi> or <hi>nay,</hi> and if ſo, they are forbidden in that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> Nay, that prohibition ſeems to be meant principally of ſwearing by the Creature, as appears by what follows in the Text.</p>
                  <p>To atteſt a Creature, as if it knew our hearts, or were able to judge us, is ridiculous idolatry. To ſwear by the Creature, is to take Gods Name in vain: for it is a manifeſt abuſing of his works. The Bleſſed Virgin was an excellent piece of Divine Handy-work, but ſhe was not made to ſwear by: This is an Honour hatt ſhe never dream'd of, when ſhe Propheſy'd that all Generations ſhould call her Bleſſed. All our Divines
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107613:91"/> (I think) agree, that Swearing is an Act of Worſhip: How ſtrangely then do Proteſtants contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that deny the worſhiping of Saints, and yet ſwear ordinarily by the <hi>Lady;</hi> and yet more Nonſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally than ſo too, when they ſwear by the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which yet they deny to be.</p>
                  <p>The Example of <hi>David</hi> and others, ſaying, <hi>As thy Soul liveth,</hi> will not juſtifie: The beſt Expoſitors ſay it is no more, than <hi>As ſure as thou livest.</hi> Nay, <hi>Eſtius,</hi> and other learned Commentators ſay, That <hi>Joſeph's life of Pharaoh,</hi> (for ſo the words are in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) are but a vehement ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He is not one that underſtands the buſineſs of the World, the beſt Markets and Bargains, the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous way of Trading, the beſt ſeaſons of Buying and Selling, and getting Gain.</p>
                  <p>He is not one that is ſubtile in counſel, and knows how to antevert, ſuppreſs, over-reach an Enemy, ſo wiſe was <hi>Huſhai,</hi> the Friend of <hi>David,</hi> the Friend of God.</p>
                  <p>But, in general, <hi>he is wiſe to do evil,</hi> (as the Devil is) to advance the intereſt of the World, and the Fleſh, above the Intereſt of God, above Juſtice, Truth, Charity, Peace, Purity: and is more particularly deſcribed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James.</hi> He is deſcribed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as one double and unſincere; by the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> as one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, envious, contentious, harſh, implacable, mercileſs, unfruitful, partial, and hypocritical.</p>
                  <p>It is evident by the light of Scripture, that all theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> Impurity, Envy, Contentiouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are works of the <hi>Fleſh, Earthly, Deviliſh,</hi> and certain

                  <p>I take <hi>Pure,</hi> to be a general deſcription of the heavenly Wiſdom, and all the <hi>ſpecies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> following do partake of it, ſo the <hi>worldly Wiſdom</hi> is in general <hi>impure.</hi> All Sin indeed is Impurity, the propereſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it. Therefore the Devil himſelf is in the Goſpel deſcrib'd by this eſpecially, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Spirit.</hi> So that I will not make Impurity in the Abſtract a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Head of Meditation, but will a little inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107613:92"/> impure Wiſdom in the Concrete, without interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with any of the Particulars that follow in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Impure Wiſdom is a Symptom of a <hi>Worldly Mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the <hi>pure Wiſdom</hi> is, as the Apoſtle phraſeth it, to be <hi>wiſe unto that which is good,</hi> Rom. 16. 19. So the <hi>impure Wiſdom</hi> is, to be <hi>wiſe to do evil,</hi> as the Prophet phraſeth it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 22. Of this there are ſeveral kinds, beſides what the Apoſtle reckons up in the following words.</p>
                  <p>They are impurely wife, who make uſe of their cunning or ſubtilty to undermine or over-reach others in Tranſactions, contrary to Plainneſs and Simplicity! That take advantage of others Ignorance or Weakneſs in matter of Conſultation, Bargain, Law, or the like, to hurt them.</p>
                  <p>That alſo is <hi>impure Wiſdom,</hi> which ſerves Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Violence. Thus wiſe were <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Counſellors: They took a wiſe courſe, but what was it for? To oppreſs and murder, <hi>Exod. 1. 10. Come, let us deal wiſely,</hi> &amp;c. Was it not a cunning way of killing, to make the Midwives, the <hi>Lucinae,</hi> to be the Inſtruments of uſhering the Children into the ſhades of death; to eſcape the guilt of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, by only bidding them to drown one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</p>
                  <p>That alſo is <hi>impure Wiſdom,</hi> that ſerves the Luſt of Fornication and Adultery. I have read of many witty devices for the ſatisfaction of Luſt; the Poets furniſh us with abundance of them, even amongſt their very Gods. And I think the Moral of all thoſe Transformations of himſelf that <hi>Jupiter</hi> made, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to deſcribe this amarous Impurity, this impure Wiſdom. That of the golden ſhower eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is acted over every day; whereby many handſome
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107613:93"/> Bodies are debauched, and pretty People corrupted. What female conſtitution ſo hard and dry, as not to be ſoftned by a ſhower of gold, eſpecially if it come from above? But the Scripture inſtance is moſt authentick, of ſubtile <hi>Jonadab</hi> who taught his Friend <hi>Amnon</hi> a way, how he might ſatisfie his Luſt upon his Siſter <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> 2 Sam. 13.</p>
                  <p>That alſo is <hi>impure wiſdom,</hi> that ſerves Ambition. How wonderful witty ſome men are to contrive their own advancement! How Courtly and Complimental is <hi>Abſalom!</hi> He condeſcends to kiſs the ordinary ſort of people, to gain them.

                        </gap>!</hi> Would any one have thought that his kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their faces, was only in order to their kiſſing his hand? Yea, the good man is troubled to ſee all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be as Sheep with a Shepherd; he pities them, that ail'd nothing; he aſperſes the Government, though it was the Government of his Father; and promiſes fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he were made Judge in the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>That alſo is <hi>impure wiſdom,</hi> that makes Laws for Snares; in what kind of Society ſoever it be, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not. God gives no Laws, but what are for our good, and if men make Laws, which they matter not much, whether they be broken or kept, ſo they may but have an occaſion to exact the Penalty, it is far from the Nature of God, and the Method of Him that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the World. This is to debauch Juſtice, and make her a Bawd to Covetouſneſs or Revenge.

                  <p>Near of Kin to this, is that wiſdom that lays Baits, and offers Temptations to men, to cauſe them to offend, and then puniſhes them for offending.

                     <hi>MEDITAT. LXXXV.</hi> Of Envy and Envious Wiſdom.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Earthly, Fleſhly,</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh Wiſdom,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed more particularly by the bitter Envying with which it is attended, or which it does attend upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Envy</hi> ſprings from <hi>Poverty:</hi> And although it be found in great and rich men, yet it is when they fanſie themſelves poor; and herein indeed they are inferior to them whom they envy.</p>
                  <p>The more pure and perfect any Being is, the more free from Envy. The All-ſufficient God envies no good to his Creature. However theſe words are to be underſtood—<hi>Now lest he put forth his hand, and take of the Tree of Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is plain and certain, that God deſires that all men ſhould be ſaved, and come unto the knowledge of the Truth. He was ſo far from envying the ſtation of man, that he hedg'd him in with a ſevere Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and ſo far from envying his Recovery, that he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107613:94"/> ſent his Son to make a painful Inquiry, a diligent Search for him, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</p>
                  <p>The holy Angels, his Menial Servants, imitate him; they continue their deſpiſed Miniſtry to wretched Man, contribute what they can to his Converſion, and rejoice in it. The Rhetorical deſcription that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet makes of the welcome that the damned or the miſerable give to the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Monarch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 9. as fitly agrees to them: Their Charity rejoices, as much as the others Malignity.</p>
                  <p>The Sun in the Firmament, as if it were afraid that Man ſhould lie in darkneſs, riſes and rejoices to run its Race, and without diſdain or envy ſheds abroad its influences upon the faireſt, and the vileſt parts of the World.</p>
                  <p>The Rain deſcends upon the barren ground to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich it, and upon the Rich to make it yet richer.</p>
                  <p>The richer any Man is in any endowment or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, the leſs he is grieved at the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others. The contented Man, be he who he will, is the Richeſt; therefore he is the freeſt from Envy.</p>
                  <p>When the Devil was fallen from his Happineſs, he envied the Happineſs of Man yet ſtanding, and ſought to bring him into the ſame condemnation with himſelf; ſo that the Wiſdom that ſerves Envy, may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Deviliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is well call'd <hi>Earthly</hi> too; for it is found pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dominant in none but earthly minds. <hi>David</hi> indeed caſt an envious glance at the proſperity of the wicked men of his time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 3. But it was but a glance, he did not allow himſelf in it; he calls himſelf a Fool, and a Beaſt for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. But a predominant envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temper is <hi>worldly;</hi> it is contrary to the Divine
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107613:94"/> temper of Charity, and to the nature of that bleſſed Being, whoſe Name is <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Wiſdom that ſerves Envy, is a <hi>worldly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Envy travels with many Plots and Projects, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine Wiles, to ſupplant its Rivals, and undermine its Superiors. Envious Men are the eldeſt Sons of the old Serpent; they reſemble him, as being his genuine Off-ſpring, and moſt natural Spawn: Them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he inſpires, and aſſiſts with his Wiles and Methods.</p>
                  <p>

                        </gap> Eye be evil, becauſe God's is good! But rejoice rather in all the Bounty of God expreſs'd towards all men. Rejoice in them all, as if they were thy own, which is the honeſteſt way of making them thine own. Do Men excel thee in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Imitate them. Do they excel thee in Wealth, Power, or Preferment? Rather pity them, and fear for them, lest their Proſperity deſtroy them, than envy them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inſtances of the Envious Wiſdom are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>One while Envy will break out into open Wars, kill and ſlay all before it. How did the two proud Princes fill all <hi>Italy</hi> with Blood and Confuſion; of which their own Poet aſſigns a cauſe, in the character that he gives of them—<hi>Nec ferre potest Coeſarve priorem, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pejuſve parem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another while it lays ſnares privily, and like a deadly Peſtilence, walks in the dark; like a Serpent in the way, like an Adder in the path, that biteth the Horſe-heels, ſo that his Rider ſhall fall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:107613:95"/>
                  <p>One while it rages, and profeſſes its ſelf an Enemy; another while it glavers, and makes great ſhew of friendſhip. <hi>Saul</hi> poſſeſs'd with this Devil, will give away his Daughter; if by her he may enſnare the man that had kill'd his Thouſands.</p>
                  <p>One while it will behave it ſelf proudly, to outvy a Competitor; another while it will behave it ſelf hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, lick the duſt, proſtrate it ſelf ſhamefully, lie down under the feet of its Rival, if by that means he may be made to ſtumble and fall: <hi>He croucheth and humbleth himſelf,</hi> that the Rival may fall by that means.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it acts by Cruelty, as in <hi>Cain;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Policy, as in the <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is covetous, and receives money, as in the <hi>chief Fathers,</hi> Gen. 37. ſometimes it is prodigal, and ſpends money, as in the chief Prieſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it will put on the Vizard of Devotion, as in <hi>Jezabel.</hi> This ſame was a dear Daughter of the Serpent; her he inſpir'd with ſpecial Wiles to get <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s Vincyard, as we read in the Story, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>All theſe, and the like to theſe, are Inſtances of the Serpentine Wiſdom; and ſuch a kind of Wiſdom, to ſerve the deſigns of Envy, is a Symptom of a <hi>Lover of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, Give me that full contentment with my own condition, that true valuation of things, that ſincere love of all men, that I may not envy any; and that this may be my rejoicing at the last, the teſtimony of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, I have had my converſation in the world!</hi>

                     <hi>COntentiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Strivings</hi> are another work of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and a Symptom of a <hi>worldly Mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>contend,</hi> and that earneſtly too, for the Truth, is not the <hi>worldly Contention.</hi> Though the Truth be never ſo mean, we ought to <hi>contend earneſtly,</hi> and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all things,</hi> rather then <hi>deny it:</hi> But ſome Truths are ſo mean, that a man ought not to <hi>contend</hi> for the propagation of them, nor <hi>ſuffer</hi> for the profeſſion of them. I believe that <hi>Paul</hi> had a Cloak, and I would ſuffer a man to take my Coat, and Cloak alſo, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than deny it: But it is ſuch a Truth, as I would not <hi>contend</hi> for the profeſſion or propagation of, nor trouble the Churches peace, nor the Conſciences of men about. I cannot tell whether many matters of Order and Diſcipline may not be of the ſame value with the Apoſtles Cloak: poſſibly they hang as looſe from the Eſſentials of Religion, as his Cloak did from him, and Religion may live and be kept warm without them.</p>
                  <p>But to <hi>contend earneſtly,</hi> to <hi>ſtrive unto blood</hi> for the defence of the Eſſential things of Religion, is Heroical, and an argument of a powerful Lover of God.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>contend about worldly Intereſts,</hi> if they be weighty, if they cannot be amicably adjuſted, ſo it be with moderation, charity, and meekneſs, and no more zeal than bears proportion to the thing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, before a lawful Judge, is not the <hi>Worldly Contention.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:107613:96"/>
                  <p>There is a ſort of Magiſterial men who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn every man for contentious that appears in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his own right, though never ſo duly; nay, that will brand every man for obſtinate and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that will not tamely ſuffer himſelf to be capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by their reaſonings, be they never ſo weak; and pin hisr Faith upon their Sleeve, though it be never ſo ragged or rotten. Theſe men themſelves are the moſt contentious, and the trueſt Authors of Schiſm.</p>
                  <p>But the Worldly contention is, when men contend eagerly or chargeablely about ſmall matters; or are reſolv'd to part with nothing of their right in any caſe for peace ſake.</p>
                  <p>When men delight to be in Controverſies, and to have their hand againſt every man. As ſome Fiſhes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in muddied or troubled waters, ſo ſome men are never in their own element but then.</p>
                  <p>When men contend to ſhew their own Parts, to oſtentate their Power, or merely for the Senſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of overcoming: all this is carnal.</p>
                  <p>It is contentious wiſdom, when men are cunning and active to beget and promote differences in the World. It is ſtrange but true, that ſome men love diviſions in the World, for diviſions ſake, after the example of the Devil; though many do it out of pride or covetouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Serpent was cunning to ſow diſcord between God and Man, and they are of a Serpentine breed that are ingenious and ſtudious to make diſſention.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral inſtances of this contentious wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The chooſing of a fit ſeaſon is one inſtance; as the <hi>inimicus homo</hi> that came by night (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 25.) <hi>While men ſlept, the Enemy came and ſowedtares.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>To prefer Contention before Peace, Diviſion before Union, though by that diviſion we might ſerve a <hi>worldly</hi> Intereſt of our own, is <hi>worldly:</hi> It is to trouble the Waters, that we may fiſh in them, I mean get money, or ſtrengthen our Parties.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. LXXXVII.</hi> Of Implacableneſs, and implacable Wiſdom.</head>
                  <p>AN <hi>implacable ſpirit,</hi> is a <hi>Worldly ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>onely holy Implacableneſs</hi> is, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to ſin, to hate it with a perfect hatred.</p>
                  <p>The Nature of God can never be reconcil'd to Sin, till Light and Darkneſs be reconcil'd:- But God is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reconcil'd to the penitent Sinner, and ſo ought we.</p>
                  <p>Good men are very <hi>placable,</hi> as appears in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Joſeph</hi> towards his Brethren, of <hi>David</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Abigail,</hi> and <hi>Shimei,</hi> and many more. For they remember what is charg'd upon them, <hi>If thy Brother ſin againſt thee ſeven times a day, and ſo oft repent, thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi> I ſuppoſe alſo they think and argue with themſelves, <hi>What are the Injuries done to me, in compariſon of the Offences that I commit againſt God? And have not I much more reaſon to forgive, than to expect Forgiveneſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not <hi>Implacableneſs</hi> to ſuſpend truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards a perſon, that has Notoriouſly deceiv'd, though he profeſs Repentance, till we have had good experience of his faithfulneſs; but when we have good proof, we ought to reſtore him into the ſame place in our hearts, that ever he had.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:107613:97"/>
                  <p>It is implacableneſs, when men will not forgive and forget; that is, not to remember, as to retaliate, or upbraid, or ſo much as to bear a grudge. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if ſatisfaction be offer'd, or repentance profeſt; yea though neither be, yet we ought to be eaſy to forgive, and of a readineſs to be reconcil'd, when ever terms are offered. Yea though no terms of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation be offer'd, no ſatisfaction made, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance profeſt, we ought on our part to lay down all enmity, to be free from all hatred towards our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hatred</hi> (ſays the excellent Dr. <hi>Moor</hi>) lies croſs in the heart of a good man.</p>
                  <p>If thy brother repent, forgive him: True, but that does not imply, that if he do not repent, we ſhould not forgive him. We ought after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, to ſeek reconciliation, and propound terms of reconciliation though we be the party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and to ſeek to bring an offending brother to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, not ſo much in order to our forgiving him, as becauſe it is a ſaving a Soul from Hell, becauſe it is for his good to repent. For vengeance is not ours; the Sun ſhould not go down upon our wrath. Anger may paſs through the mind of a wiſe man, but it reſteth and lodgeth onely in the boſom of fools.</p>
                  <p>Some are ſo implacable, that no tract of time ſhall wear out their reſentments, no ſubmiſſion can allay, no gifts remove, no interceſſion aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage them; but they demiſe their hatred unto heirs and executors, and entail the quarrel upon poſterity. If theſe men could alledge an Ordinance of God for this, ſuch an one as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had to authorize them to an endleſs war againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> it would excuſe them well: but till then, it muſt paſs for a work of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107613:98"/> the fleſh, and an imitation of the grand hater of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>The Implacable Wiſdom is cunning to conceal its reſentments that they ſhall not be diſcern'd, that in due time it may execute revenge ſo as not to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>It inſtructs men in many wily methods, to contrive ways of revenge, to make and take fit opportunities. <hi>Abſalom</hi> made as if he took no notice of the injury done his Siſter for the ſpace of two full years: After that he invites his Brother <hi>Amnon</hi> to a Feaſt, to make him drunk, that he might then quarrel with him, and kill him: He conceals his anger from his Brother, <hi>He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>MEDITAT. LXXXVIII.</hi> Of Unmercifulneſs, and Mercileſs Wiſdom.</head>
                  <p>THe Wiſdom which is from above, is full of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; therefore that which is Cruel and Mercileſs, is Senſual, Worldly, and Devilliſh.</p>
                  <p>Mercifulneſs is an Attribute of God, wherein he ſeems to Glory; he makes it his Name, whereby he would be known and call'd: The Lord proclaimed the Name of the Lord, <hi>The Lord God, Merciful and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Long-ſuffering, abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and ſin, Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. Here are ten Phraſes of like importance: And as for his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added in ſhort, that he <hi>will by no means clear the guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Compariſon can there be in Infinites? And yet the Pſalmiſt exalting the Merciful nature of God, tells us that his Mercies are over all his Works; and elſe where, his Mercies are far above the Heavens.</p>
                  <p>Angels and Good Men are commended for this, The Angels watch for the good and ſafety of the Elect, and bear them up in their hands. Good men are Merciful, they Give, they Lend, they Pity, they Help and Heal, they do Good to Enemies, they Forgive, and Pray that God would do ſo too; <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the nature of the Devil is cruel murderous; He was a Murderer from the beginning: and his eldeſt Son <hi>Cain</hi> imitated him exactly for Envy and Murder.</p>
                  <p>There is a great deal of cruelty in taking away the life of a man unjuſtly; in extream corrections, that do not reach the life; yea in the execution of a juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107613:99"/> of death or puniſhment, there may be much cruelty in the Executioner or Spectators; according to that true ſaying of the Moraliſt, <hi>Ferus eſt qui fruitur paena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In many other things there is much cruelty. There are not onely bloody Souldiers, cruel Gladiators and Aſſaſſinates; but cruel <hi>Maſters</hi> to Servants, both in impoſing of work, and withholding of maintenance: Cruel <hi>Landlords,</hi> that ſqueeze and grind their poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
                  <p>Cruel <hi>Patrons,</hi> that conſume what their Clients have, in procuring for them what they want.</p>
                  <p>Cruel <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgions,</hi> who maintain Diſeaſes and prolong Sores; who take pleaſure in the pain, and find their own health in the ſickneſs of their Patients.</p>
                  <p>Cruel <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who govern their People with Scorpions inſtead of Scepters.</p>
                  <p>Cruel <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that either ſtarve or poyſon the Souls of men.</p>
                  <p>Nay there are Cruel <hi>Friends:</hi> I expect it will be asked: How that can be? For ought I ſee, the greateſt cruelties are practiſed under the notion of friendſhip. The oppreſſing Uſurer would have you think, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends you, when he conſumes you; that he ſupports you, when he ſupplants you; that he heals your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, when he encreaſes it; that he ſecures you, when indeed he ſecures your Eſtate to himſelf: A kindneſs much like that of him who open'd our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> her eyes a little at preſent, but ſpoyl'd her ſight for ever after.</p>
                  <p>Your oppreſſing Neighbour would be thought friendly, when he gives you the bitter pill of a dear bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſugar'd with ſix months time for Payment.</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:107613:99"/>
                  <p>This kind of Friendſhip is juſt like <hi>Hercules</hi> his dealing with <hi>Anteus</hi> in the ſtory: you would have thought he had been lovingly hugging and embracing the Giant in his arms, when he was indeed choaking and ſtrangling him.</p>
                  <p>They that have no compaſſion on the miſerable, whether they be poor or ſick, or ſinful; much more they that trample upon thoſe, whom God hath caſt down, ſcorn them whom men have harm'd, and take away the garment of the naked from him, (as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> ſpeaketh) are nothing of kin to God, nor God to them, nor ſhall ever be owned for his children, till Oſtriches are found hatcht under the wings of Storks.</p>
                  <p>The Cruel Worldly Wiſdom is that which is cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to invent torments.</p>
                  <p>Many Heatheniſh Tyrants of old have been famous for this helliſh ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>And the Modern Papiſts have endeavoured to match them; as may appear to any that reads the ſtory of the Perſecutions in <hi>Picdmont,</hi> written by the ingenious and faithful Hiſtorian Sir <hi>Samuel Morland;</hi> and by the Hiſtory of the Iriſh Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Hiſtory furniſhes us with Examples of many whom the Devil (the great <hi>Proloctonus</hi>) has inſpir'd with Cruel Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Thus Cruelly wiſe was <hi>Achitophel</hi> aginſt the life of good King <hi>David;</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> and his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices againſt the Jews.</p>
                  <p>What an helliſh Device was that, to cut off ſuch a mighty Nation, Man, Woman, and Child, by the edge of the Sword, and all for a little Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martialneſs found in one Male-content Melancholiſt amongſt them.</p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:107613:100"/>
                  <p>The offering up of poor children to <hi>Molech</hi> was cruel and unmerciful: But the Wiſdom of this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty appear'd in the loud beating of Drums, and other noiſes, made on purpoſe to ſecure their ears from any complaints that might affect them, and baracado up their hearts againſt all compaſſion. To burn the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren was cruelty, to drown their cry was cruel wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>And do we not every day ſee what devices and ſhifts unmerciful men uſe, that they may not ſhew Mercy, and to prevent all occaſions or temptations ſo to do; ſtopping their ears, ſhutting their doors, getting out of the way, pretending not to be at home, or not at leiſure, when the poor would beg or borrow ought of them? The Comedian <hi>Plautus</hi> has well deſcrib'd this churliſh uncharitable wiſdom in the perſon of <hi>Euclio;</hi> and the wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Go and come again to morrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord let me be rather accounted a pooor ſhiftleſs fool, than either be wiſe to do evil, or not to do good?</hi>

                  <p>To do ill, and to do nothing, are both kinds of Idleneſs: And though it may not look like good Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I am ſure it is good Divinity, that to be wiſe to do nothing, is to be wiſe to do evil.</p>

                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> indeed in <hi>Job</hi> ſays, that he that is wiſe may may be profitable to himſelf: and ſure he ought to be profitable to others alſo. Whatever gifts the good Spirit of God ſheds forth upon men, are given them to profit with, ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>The moſt precious mettals profit nothing. <hi>Niſi tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perato ſplendeant uſu;</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>Celata virtus paulum diſtat inertiae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fool holding his tongue (they ſay) may paſs for a wiſe man: But ſure I am that a wiſe man holding his tongue differs little from a fool.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is there not a wiſe man amongſt you?</hi> The Apoſtle implyes that it becomes wiſe men to be active, to do good to compoſe differences.</p>
                  <p>Oh but our wiſe men account it a piece of their wiſdom, not to put their fingers into the fire, (as they call it,) when there is no need. It is very true; but if there be never ſo much need, it is all one with many of theſe wiſe men.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I beleive it will be an hard thing to find any place of ſociety of men, where there is not need of wiſe mens advice and interpoſition, which ſome invidiouſly brand by the Phraſe of putting their fingers into the fire.

                  <p>
                     <hi>HYpocriſie</hi> is an artificial kind of Lying; God is Truth, and he abhors Hypocrites and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; that is, they are directly contrary to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The general Notion of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> is, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be, and have, and do, what one is not, hath not, doth not.</p>
                  <p>This is not ſimply, and in it ſelf evil. Have we not read what <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. and that by Divine Command; and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Civil Wars againſt <hi>Benjamin;</hi> how they pretended to run away, but did not, and yet were guiltleſs.</p>
                  <p>Nay, God himſelf ſometimes makes things to ſeem otherwiſe than they are; as when he made the waters to ſeem like blood, to bring in the <hi>Moabites</hi> to Battel; and made the <hi>Babylonians</hi> to hear noiſe of War, when there was no Enemy.</p>
                  <p>But this <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> becomes ſinful by Accident, by ſome ill Attendants, or ill Deſigns in the Action.</p>
                  <p>It is not abſolutely ſinful for a man to diſſemble his perſon; for a wiſe man to ſeem as if he underſtood
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107613:103"/> not, for a fool to ſeem underſtanding, for a rich man to diſſemble his riches, or a poor man his poverty: Chriſt Jeſus himſelf ſometimes conceal'd his purpoſes, and made ſhew of the contrary; as in the caſe of the Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this diſſembling becomes evil, by evil acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and is carnal, if it be attended with pride, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, ſlaviſh fear, atheiſticalneſs, or if it ſerve a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus malus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might diſguiſe himſelf and go into the Battail: But if he think to cheat the eye, or eſcape the hand of God by this means, his athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſticalneſs, not his hypocriſy, is ſinful.</p>
                  <p>The Queen of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might diſguiſe her ſelf and ſeem another woman: But if ſhe think to deceive the Prophet or the God of the Prophet, therein ſhe is Atheiſtical.</p>
                  <p>It was not <hi>Sauls</hi> diſguiſing himſelf, but his conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Devil, that was his ſin.</p>
                  <p>What was extraordinary in <hi>Davids</hi> diſſembling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aciſh,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> before <hi>Iſaac,</hi> I know not. But there ſeems to be ſo much in it, that I had rather excuſe them charitably, than boldly imitate either of them.</p>
                  <p>This ſinful Hypocriſy is either in things <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Religious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Civil</hi> Hypocriſy may be very wicked, and a Symptom of an earthly mind.</p>
                  <p>As when men profeſs and pretend to Trades, Arts or Sciences which they underſtand not; when men poofeſs to be Teacher of others, when themſelves had need to be taught. Hereby they deceive men, in impoſing falſe Wares or Doctrines upon them.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XCII.</hi> Of Scripture Hypocriſy, and Hypocritical Wiſdom.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> which the Scripture ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, and ſo vehemently inveighs againſt, is in ſhort a pretending to that Religion, which indeed a man has not. And this is done two ways, by the <hi>Amolition</hi> of Vice, and by the <hi>Oſtentation</hi> of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>In general, all Chriſtians (taken in oppoſition to Heathens) that are not renewed in the Spirit of their minds, nor conformed to the Image of Chriſt, are Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>All Profeſſors of Religion, that profeſs the true God, are entred into a Covenant Relation, are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Name of Chriſt, have taken upon them to ſight for him againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and yet are ſtrangers to true Regeneration, are of a worldly Spirit, and a fleſhly mind, are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:107613:104"/>
                  <p>We uſe indeed to diſtinguiſh between the Prophane and the Hypocrites; and the Prophane bleſs themſelves that they are not Hypocrites, they think they do not act deceitfully in their Profeſſion, becauſe they make no Profeſſion at all. This were a miſerable excuſe, if it were true, but it is falſe: For they do profeſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and by being concern'd in the Sacraments of the Goſpel, do undertake the Duties of the Goſpel, and lay claim to the bleſſings of it. Nay, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will tell you, <hi>That they hope to be ſaved, as well as the greateſt Profeſſors of them all.</hi> And ſure they cannot think to be ſaved by a Goſpel, which they do not own.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems as if Hell were inhabited with theſe two ſorts of People only, Hypocrites Unbelievers; as if the Text ſhould ſay, Unbelievers, and Falſe Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; Heathens, and Chriſtians: For there muſt be a kind of Believing to make up an Hypocrite. So then, Prophaneneſs does not hinder men from being Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; it only makes them the more groſs and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Diſſemblers, the more notorious Mockers of God.</p>
                  <p>To profeſs Religion and Vertue, is not of it ſelf Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, but indeed the neceſſary Duty of all men; eſpecially of thoſe to whom the Goſpel is come: But becauſe the Profeſſion of Religion has been ſo abuſed, therefore ſome think it is beſt to make none at all: Or rather, indeed, it is an argument of the great hatred that wicked men bear to Religion, that they hate the very name and ſhew of it, as they ſay the <hi>Panther</hi> does the very image of a man.</p>
                  <p>To deſire to appear Vertuous, is not ſimply Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: A man may both love Religion, and love the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful character of Religious too. To be Vertuous, is for our own good; to appear ſuch, is for the good of others, and for the glory of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:107613:104"/>
                  <p>To be zealous for Religion, and the promoting of it, is not <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> however it is traduced by ſome, and ſuſpected by more. True indeed, all is not zeal, pure zeal for Religion, that ſeems ſo: But yet there is a zeal for Religion, and wherever it is in Truth, it is highly commendable. Alas! what a careleſs and graceleſs Age are we fallen into, wherein mens hearts are ſo coldly diſpoſed towards Religion, that it ſhould be accounted Extaſie or Hypocriſie to be zealous for the Intereſt of Religion, which yet all profeſs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſs to be their greateſt glory.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſimply Hypocriſie for a man to conceal his Faults. That which was <hi>Sodom's</hi> ſhame, cannot be our Duty ſure, to proclaim our ſin. The next to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent, is to be aſham'd of our Faults: And who will oftentate a thing that he is aſham'd of?</p>
                  <p>But to pretend to Religion which we have not, nor care not to have; to profeſs it, or any part of it, for worldly Ends, and ſo to make it ſubſervient to carnal Selfiſhneſs: To deſire to be approved of men for any Grace or Vertue, and in the mean time not to approve our ſelves to God in the exerciſe thereof, is the more ſpecial, ſinful Hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>And this Hypocriſie is very witty: Many Wiles men uſe to ſerve Hypocriſie, and to ſeem what they are not.</p>
                  <p>One Inſtance of this worldly hypocritical wiſdom is, when men either deny or mince their ſins, that they may appear righteous before men, when in the mean time they love them, and live in them. Nay, rather than not cover their ſins, they will make a Cloak of the Vail of the Sanctuary. Thus the diſſembling <hi>Phariſees</hi> in our Saviour's days made long Prayers to hide their Covetouſneſs, and cover'd their Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs and Undutifulneſs with the pretence of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</hi> The ſame worldly wiſdom inſtructss the hypocrite
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107613:105"/> to bann and ſwagger againſt ſin in general, and the ſins of other men; in the mean time hugging his own. For would not any one think that he that Preaches frequently and ſeverely againſt Covetouſneſs, were ſome Charitable or Heavenly Soul? If a man had ſeen <hi>Jehu</hi> raging and hectoring againſt <hi>Baal,</hi> would he not have thought that had perfectly abhorr'd idolatry? But follow him to <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel,</hi> and you would be of another mind. A great artifice whereby men make their own ſins ſeem little or none at all, is to repreſent other mens as big as may be. Thus I have heard ſome men excuſe their own ſwearing by aggravating other mens lying and deceitfulneſs; their own formality and careleſneſs in religion, by railing againſt the hypocriſy and heady zeal of another ſort of men. And indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more uſual, than to endeavour to drown the cry of the ſins of the preſent times, by talking loudly of the crying ſins of the former. Oh, cry'd the Jews, Our fathers, what wicked men were they to kill the Prophets; when themſelves perſecuted and hated the great Prophet of the Church. An other great inſtance of hypocriſy is, when men aſſume to themſelves an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentate Religion, and do not heartily embrace nor love it. The Worldly Wiſdom has invented a great many artifices in this matter. Sometimes the Hipocritical, Wiſdom will inſtruct men to commend Vertue and Vertuous perſons, to ſeem vertuous. Yea it will Preach up many good works, and preſs them moſt confidently (I had almoſt ſaid impudently) with many arguments and motives, that they will not meddle with the practice of; bind ſevere duties upon their hearers, which themſelves will not touch with one of their fingers. Who has not with aſtoniſhment and loathing heard the looſe and careleſs exhort to Devotion, and dilligent Godlineſs; the Covetous to Liberality; them
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107613:105"/> require others to pray continually; and the prophane to charge the reſt that they ſwear not at all.</p>
                  <p>This wiſdom will inſtruct men to pray (eſpecially if it be in a publick place, where they may do it, <hi>clare &amp; ut audiat hoſpes</hi>) for many good gifts and graces, which they have no mind to receive; to be enabled to do many good things, which yet they never ſo much as once go about, and to be adorn'd with that holineſs, which they deride and hate, in them that are adorned with it.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the hypocritical wiſdom inſtructs men to take a good and conſtant care of their outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior and converſation, that it be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mure, and ſober, and honeſt, and as to any ſcandalous thing unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. All this is good, and yet is nothing but an artifice of the hypocritical wiſdom, if the heart in the mean time be full of Pride and Covetouſneſs, Malice and Revengefulneſs, Impurity and Impatience; if the will be ſelfiſh, and reluctant againſt the Will of God. This was the deviliſh wiſdom of the Hypocrites of old, whom the wiſdom of Heaven detected, and told them, <hi>That notwithſtanding their Sheeps cloathing, they were imvardly ravening Wolves; notwithſtanding their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cleanlineſs, and many waſhings, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly full of Exceſs and Repine; notwithſtanding their external whitings and garniſhings, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly corrupt and rotten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Artifice to ſeem Religious, is to be ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of little Faults, and zealous for lighter Duties; not but that tenderneſs of Conſcience, and zeal for all the Commands of God, are excellent Accompliſhments: But they are nothing but an Artifice of the hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wiſdom, when at the ſame time great and Camel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſins are ſwallow'd down, and the weighty matters of the Law are neglected.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:107613:106"/>
                  <p>Oh take heed of coming into the Judgment Hall for fear of being defiled; but venture to condemn and hang the innocent, if you envy him.</p>
                  <p>Be as punctual as may be in paying the Tythes to the <hi>Levite,</hi> ſo exact as to be a Cutter of Cummin, but it is no great matter for Faith and the Love of God. All the Art is here, to find out what is really little or light; for according to mens prejudices, a little variation in a matter of Ceremony or Order, muſt needs be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted a Sin as mortal as Blaſphemy; and on the other hand, a ſeemly, handſome, ceremonious obſervation, have great weight laid upon it, as the Love of God and our Neighbor.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>It is moſt generally ſuppoſed, that the Apoſtaſie and Ruine of the Devils, was their aſpiring to be as God: And the higheſt pitch of Pride is deſcribed by this; This was the Satanical ſuggeſtion that prevail'd with <hi>Eve</hi> to eat the forbidden Fruit, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the Devil miſt of it then, and miſcarry'd fouly in his attempt; yet ſuch is the pride of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and his Envy and Malignity againſt God, that ſtill it is his deſire to be taken for a God.</p>
                  <p>He has prevail'd with many, ſo to be eſteemed and worſhip'd; if not for Love, yet for Fear: as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the <hi>Indians</hi> that worſhip him, <hi>Ne noceat,</hi> leſt he ſhould do them a miſchief.</p>
                  <p>He has put off himſelf to ſome as a great Benefactor to Mankind, and ſo has obtain'd a reverential Worſhip. The Devil at <hi>Delphos</hi> had obtain'd ſo much Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that the People generally conſulted him about future Contingencies, which is a Divine Honour and Sacrifice to him there and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>It was the Pride of the Devil that ſuggeſted to the Philoſophers a twofold eternal Principle, <hi>Boni &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:107613:108"/> to make himſelf an Anti-Deity, rather to be the God of Miſchief, than no God at all.</p>
                  <p>And from the ſame proud Nature it was, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected all the ancient Heathens to feign a God of Hell, as well as of Heaven; a <hi>Pluto,</hi> as well as a <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether it was his Pride or Malice that put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tempting Chriſt, <hi>to fall down and worſhip him,</hi> I cannot tell; but certainly he muſt needs have an high opinion of himſelf, that durſt make ſuch a bold mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Son of God.

                  <p>It muſt be confeſt, this is the groſſeſt ſort of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> and, poſſibly, ſome will deny that it is poſible that any ſhould be ſo groſs as to commit it: But the Apoſtle puts it out of doubt, ſaying, <hi>The things that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>There are indeed other ſorts of <hi>Idolatry</hi> more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, when men worſhip the Sun and Moon for Gods; or intentionally, and yet remotely, worſhip the true God, by the <hi>medium</hi> of Images made with hands. To think theſe Images are Gods, is exceeding groſs: And yet it ſhould ſeem by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as if ſome were ſo groſs as to eſteem them ſo. But ſuppoſe they only fanſie that theſe Images are only inhabited by ſome ſpecial preſence of the Deity, ſtill it is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and an interpretative worſhiping of the Devil; for it is a ſervice that God has forbidden, and the Devil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſuppoſe theſe Images to be only Monitory, and to be of no further uſe, than to put in mind of God, or to excite Devotion; yet how can it eſcape the Brand of Idolatrous Will-worſhip? For who has
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107613:109"/> required this at mens hands? Yea, who knoweth not, That God hath flatly forbidden the worſhiping of him <hi>by the likeneſs of any thing in Heaven or Earth, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, I ſuppoſe, was the Caſe of the Golden Calves, which no one ever imagin'd to reſemble the Deity, nor to be inſpired or inhabited by them; only they ſerved to put in mind of God, and excite Devotion: And yet this <hi>Mcſcholatrye</hi> was curſed and abhorred of God; and ſo were all thoſe that were addicted to it.</p>

Be aſham'd, O Noble Spirit, of the imputation of ſuch groſsneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be afraid of ſuch boldneſs; lest the jealous God ſhould interpret that damnable Idolatry, which poſſibly thou art not convinc'd of, but yet hast a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of, and at best hast no need of. Canſt thou not as well worſhip and pray to the inviſible God, without the help of a monitory Image, as love and delight in thy abſent Friend, without the aſſiſtance of his Picture, or a Preſent? How doſt thou think to ſee and ſerve God ſhortly, when thy bodily eyes ſhall be full of duſt, and all corporeal Organs ſo utterly out of Tune, that thou ſhalt not be able to make uſe of any of them?

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XCVI.</hi> Of Interpretative Witchcraft.</head>
                  <p>BEſides this groſs and formal Witchcraft, there is another ſort not ſo groſs and palpable, which yet denominates men <hi>Allies</hi> to the God of this World.</p>
                  <p>There are amongſt men <hi>Allies</hi> by <hi>Covenants,</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and Formal Ratification: And there are alſo <hi>Allies</hi> by Kindneſs, Conjunctneſs of Intereſt, and Faithful <hi>Correſpondence.</hi> So it is here: There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that keep Correſpondence with the evil Spirit, that have not articled with him, or deliver'd themſelves up to him by a Formal Covenant.</p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:107613:111"/>
                  <p>I dare not poſitively conclude, <hi>That the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy has quite forſaken the World:</hi> But I apprehend there is not much need of it, ſince the perfecting of the Canon of the Scripture. I ſuppoſe it is very rare, (if it be at all) and that it only reſts upon pure and holy minds, and upon very weighty occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Whether the Skilful may <hi>Aſtrologically</hi> or <hi>Chiroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> gueſs at the future ſtate of Nations or Perſons, has been diſputed often amongſt Learned men: And for my part, I do not ſee ſuch convincing Arguments on either part, as to adventure to interpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I do believe that the <hi>Devil</hi> can tell many things, which we cannot, and that he is very officous to them that conſult him: But withal I think that no man ought to conſult him, though it were in an important Caſe, ſuch as King <hi>Saul's</hi> was. For he is the grand Apoſtate and Rebel againſt God: And the Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Almighty commit a kind of Treaſon, to keep any Correſpondence with the Wicked One.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is wonderful <hi>unſafe</hi> to be ſo great with him: for his <hi>Dona,</hi> are <hi>Hamata;</hi> and his very gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Curioſity, only ſerves to a further and pernicious acquaintance. It is not likely he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunicate his skill for nothing, nor his ſecrets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a further ſecret deſign of making his Clients to be his Votaries.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is <hi>imprudent:</hi> For his ſworn Enmity againſt Man is ſuch, that no man can be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but he will deceive him. He will be true to his Clients in one thing, that he may deceive them in many: Nay, by his ambiguous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he often deceives, even in ſpeaking the Truth.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:107613:112"/>
                  <p>As for <hi>Necromancy,</hi> I confeſs I know not what Converſe ſeparate Souls do hold with the embodied; neither know I whether it pleaſes God at any time to ſend any of them, or faſter them to come amongſt us upon any Errand of his, or of their own. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is out of the power of the Devil to diſturb, or employ and bleſſed Souls upon his Errand. And if by his intereſt one might come to an acquaintance with ſome of the other ſort, it were unwarrantable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, and indeed ſuperfluous too; for what need he be employ'd to fetch another perſon to tell a thing, which himſelf can tell better?</p>
                  <p>But beſides all theſe, there are ordinarily a ſort of bold People, that conſult the Devil blind folded, and are kind of <hi>Conjurers,</hi> and do not know it. Such (at leaſt) I take all the <hi>Augures</hi> and <hi>Aruſpices,</hi> and Prieſtly Perſons of old to have been, who conſulted the Intrails of Beaſts, the Flying of Birds, and the like thereby to know future comingent Events. And amongſt our ſelves there are many that uſe Rites and Ceremonies, Words and Phraſes, of which no ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal account can be given, which nothing in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Divinity does direct. I confeſs if God do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound or direct a thing of which we can give no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical account, yet it in to be believed. If the true Prophet, whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> was well known, bade, <hi>Go and waſh in Jordan;</hi> if Chriſt dreſt the Eyes of the blind Man with Mortar, it is not to be wondred at nor disbelieved: But when we have no Divine Authority, nor can give any Philoſophical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is very ſuſpicable and hazardous.</p>
                  <p>It is obſerved by ſome, That the Devil loves to be believed at a venture, ſuch is his Pride: And that he loves to be worſhiped in the dark, his beſt Servants being they that do his Will without inquiring into
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107613:112"/> the reaſon of his Commands: whereas God loves to be converſt with in a way of light and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>And that the Devil ſhould give life and operation, and ſignification to his own Inſtitutions, and be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually preſent by his influences, to deceive the Simple, or gratifie the Curious, needs not to be wondered at. Many Stories tell how fain he would be reputed a God, as we have partly ſeen before; and therefore he courts the implicite Faith of men, and their blind Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aaron</hi> caſt the Ear-rings into the Fire, and <hi>there came out this Calf.</hi> How far the Devil might aſſiſt in this Action, I cannot tell; but it is eaſie to believe he does aſſiſt in the curious Inquiries, and unwary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of <hi>Aſtrological</hi> men, and others, and enables them by his unſeen hand to predict and perform many things, which yet they never give him Thanks for; but either aſcribe to ſome falſe natural Cauſe, or won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, as a ſtupendious ſecret, of which no account can be given.</p>
                  <p>The merciful <hi>Jeſus</hi> apprehended little <hi>Zacheus</hi> climbing up into the Tree, out of meer Curioſity to ſee him, and brought ſalvation to him. The Cruel <hi>Apollyon</hi> is courteous alſo, to gratifie the Curioſity of vain men, and meet them half the way, and go home with them too: but it is not to bring ſalvation to them, but them to damnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bleſſed God, Heal me of all Licentiouſneſs and Unſubduedneſs of Underſtanding! Cloath me with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, that I may be wiſe according to what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; both on this ſide Heaven, and on this ſide Hell: lest by over-daring on the one hand, I provoke thee to blind me; or on the other hand, tempt the Devil to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107613:113"/> enlighten me. And as I am a reaſonable Creature, ſo grant that I may always act rationally; not ſmothering the Candle of the Lord ſet up in my Soul, not quitting the guidance of it to be led in ways of darkneſs, and blind mazes, wherein I can neither walk with ſafety nor ſatisfaction!</hi>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XCVII.</hi> Of the Children of the Devil, and particularly of Self-will.</head>
                  <p>THE third ſort of the Devil's Followers, for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſake, I call his <hi>Children:</hi> a Phraſe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Spirit of God, and therefore not to be bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled at.</p>
                  <p>But here, for diſtinctneſs in Proceeding, I muſt conſider the <hi>Devil</hi> under a double Notion, <hi>viz.</hi> as a <hi>particular Being,</hi> an Apoſtate Spirit; or a <hi>corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or the Spirit of Apoſtaſie.</p>
                  <p>Thus I think the Scripture conſiders him: ſometimes as an Apoſtate Spirit, as in <hi>Job</hi> 2 and <hi>Mat.</hi> 4 and frequently in the Goſpel, where he is ſaid to be caſt out of the Bodies of Demoniacks. Sometimes as a Nature of Spirit of Apoſtaſie, <hi>The Spirit that worketh in the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> So Learned Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107613:113"/> by the Context, interpret that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. and that of our Saviour, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This need not ſeem ſtrange: for ſo the Scripture ſpeaks in other caſes. Thus it ſpeaks of <hi>Christ</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as a <hi>Perſon,</hi> in the whole Hiſtory of his Life; ſometimes as a New and Divine <hi>Nature, Christ formed in you,</hi> and <hi>Christ in you the hope of glory.</hi> The like may be ſaid of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> The Spirit of Deceit and Deluſion is called <hi>Antichrist—This is a Deceiver, and an Antichrist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe apoſtate Spirits (for there are many of them) are frequently ſpoken of in Scripture in the ſingular number, and call'd <hi>the Devil, the Wicked One,</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> although there be Devils many, and Satans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The reaſon of this, I conceive, is either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one and the ſame Principle of Rebellion and Malignity acts them all, as if they were but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Or one is call'd the Devil by way of Eminence, as being Ring leader and Prince of Devils: Or in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to God who is but one, the wicked Spirits are call'd the Devil, to make the oppoſition the plainer, between the two Principles of Good and Evil, the two Kingdoms of Light and Darkn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>This Apoſtate Spirit, though he have no iſſue of his own Body, yet is ſaid to have many Children, amongſt thoſe that are properly the Children of men.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:107613:114"/>
                  <p>According to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Idiom of Speech, Perſons and Things are ſaid to be the Children of thoſe whom they moſt reſemble: For Reſemblance ſeems to reſult from the Relation of a Child to his Parent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they lie under ſome ſuſpicion of Illegitimate, who carry nothing of their Parents about with them, but their Names onely.</p>
                  <p>Thus they are <hi>the Children of God,</hi> who do the Works of God, <hi>John</hi> 8. 41. Who are <hi>followers of him,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. They are <hi>the Children of Abraham,</hi> who imitate the Faith and Piety of <hi>Abraham,</hi> John 8. and <hi>the Daughters of</hi> Sarah, who reſemble her, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 6.

                  <p>THE proper Notion of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> is, not to be ſenſible of a good Turn done to us, when we know it.</p>

                  <p>To proceed juſtly againſt any Benefactor, is not ſimply <hi>Ingratitude:</hi> for my Love to Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ought to prevail againſt any particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or the ſenſe of any perſonal kindneſs.

                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:107613:115"/>
                  <p>But to be injurious to a perſon that I am beholden to, adds Ingratitude to Injuſtice: This is the very natural complexion of the Devil, who hates the God from whom he has receiv'd his very Being.</p>
                  <p>All ſin in man wilfully committed againſt God, has Ingratitude in it; but eſpecially the rebellious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Devil, who knows when he ſins, and has receiv'd greater obligations from God, than Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

For if Men and Devils agree in the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition, it is no great matter though they differ in Name. The Devil is content men ſhould call themſelves by what Names they pleaſe, yea, <hi>Puritans</hi> or <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> ſo that in the mean time they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to <hi>Be,</hi> what he is.</p>
                  <p>As I doubt not but that there are many men, who love God, and reſemble him, and are in the beſt ſenſe Godly, (that is, God-like men) who yet cannot diſcourſe of him Metaphyſically, nor underſtand clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as to the Notion) what Relation they ſtand in to him: So it is not to be doubted, but that many who are ſtrangers to the perſon of the Devil, are, in a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

                  <p>Yea many that are afraid of the perſon of the Devil, and almoſt tremble at the mention of his name, and cry, God bleſs us from him, do by the impreſſion of a devilliſh nature, maintain converſe, and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity with him.

                  <p>Many that hate the Devil and defie him, and ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt him with all the <hi>anathema',</hi> imaginable, are yet very good friends with him: For however they curſe his name, and the number of his name, yet they receive his Mark, not upon their Foreheads, but upon their very Hearts. Yea I believe one may ſay of the Devil, (as the Proverb ſays of the Fox) that he is no where better entertain'd, than where he is moſt defi'd and bann'd. No man, ſays the Apoſtle, ſpeaking by the Spirit of Chriſt, calleth Chriſt accurſed; but doubtleſs men curſe the Devil by a Devilliſh Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Perhaps the hatred of the perſon of the Devil is not a thing ſo divine as ſome take it to be: For my own part, I am more enclin'd to pity, than to hate him. Men do by the Devil, as they ſay the <hi>Trojans</hi> did by the <hi>Grecians;</hi> they hated them, and yet at the ſame time unawars open'd their Gates for them, and receiv'd them into the very Heart of their City.</p>

If a man had as good eyes as <hi>Jacob</hi> had, he might ſee the Rams that leap upon theſe Cattle, to be ſpeckled and grizled, the Spirit that impregnates them to be no other than the Spirit of Apoſtaſie, and a black <hi>Incubus</hi> aſcending up out of the Bottomleſs Pit.</p>
                  <p>Neither let any one think that the ſpiritual Sins of Pride, Malice, and the like, are only to be called the <hi>Deviliſh Nature.</hi> For what though the perſon of the Devil do neither eat nor drink, nor heap up Silver and Gold, nor acquaint himſelf with ſtrange Fleſh? Yet Drunkenneſs and Gluttony, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Laſciviouſneſs, are really Branches of the <hi>Deviliſh Nature,</hi> and belong to the Spirit of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuſie: For ſo it is deſcrib'd by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107613:118"/> That is Satanical, be it what it will, that ſavoureth not the Things of God—<hi>Get thee behind me Sathan.</hi> And why Sathan?

True; but our Saviour puts it into a more general Phraſe, <hi>Thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourest not the Things of God;</hi> implying, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever oppoſes the Will and Ways of God, is Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</p>
                  <p>Men fear Hell, as a bad place, rather than as an evil and wicked ſtate; and ſo they hate and bann the Devil, as a Name, or Perſon at moſt, rather than as a ſinful and apoſtate Nature.</p>
                  <p>We read indeed of the Devil poſſeſſing the Bodies of men, which ordinarily occur'd in the days of the Son of man: But (though it be not ſo much obſerv'd, nor does ſo much aſtoniſh) the poſſeſſion that he has of the Souls of men, is much more common, and far more dreadful. Is it not much more lamentable, that the Devil ſhould poſſeſs the Souls of men, than their Bodies? And does he not really poſſeſs all unregenerate minds? Is not that Spirit, that apoſtate Nature which worketh in the Children of Diſobedience, he? Is not Diabolical Impreſſion, a real Impregnation? As good men are the Children of God, and <hi>pleni Deo,</hi> more than wicked men, by a God-like Nature; ſo are all unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, all Lovers of the World, Children of the Devil, under his Dominion, poſſeſt by him, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by him; and indeed by Scripture-warrant, they are ſo many Satans in the fleſh, and Devils incarnate.</p>
                  <p>Learned men think that in <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. the word <hi>Satan</hi> is to be read <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> as if the Spirit of Apoſtaſie did denominate the Devil. And the wicked and apoſtate Nature, wherever it is found predominant, denominates men deviliſh; otherwiſe <hi>Judas</hi> was no more a Devil than any of us.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:107613:118"/>
                  <p>The Deviliſh Nature is miſchievous and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and ever oppoſing and perverting the right ways of the Lord. And they that are acted by it, are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very account, by the Apoſtle, call'd <hi>Children of the Devil,</hi> Acts 13. 10.</p>
                  <p>The War that the Captain of our Salvation mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is not ſo much againſt the damned Regiments, the Apoſtate Spirits, (though he has plainly triumph'd over them, and (I ſuppoſe) his bright Legions do ſtill under his Banner oppoſe and rout them; as manifeſt Hoſtility being kept up amongſt them, as we read of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Troops of <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi>) as againſt that wicked nature, and thoſe wicked works, which eſtrange the Souls of Men from God; as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly tells us, when he deſcribes the deſign and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of the Redeemer, he ſays, <hi>It was to deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> So then, all that work the works of darkneſs and wickedneſs, are his Followers, and each man of them in his meaſure, a little Devil. Or whether you call them his Subjects, Servants, Slaves, Children, Apprentices, (with relation to his work) his inſpired ones, his Scholars; the Scripture will warrant all theſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Is there any greater wonder to man in the World, than a worldly man? What Decrees of Heaven, what Providence of God, what Fate of Providence, what Temptations from without, what Inclinations from within ſhall we run to, to give an account of this fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apoſtaſie of ſo great, ſo noble a part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from his bleſſed Centre, his pure Life, his paradiſic State!</p>
                  <p>Whether we think of the corruption of the humane Nature in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet it is a marvellous Myſtery how a Perſon of his purity and ſoundneſs came to ſin, and how perſons of that remoteneſs from him as we are, ſhould ſin in him: Though neither of which ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, yet both of them ſeem inexplicable. If we lay the fault at the door of each pre-exiſtent Soul, it ſeems indeed to be juſt, but ſtill it is as ſtrange as it was before. For ſo every ſingle Soul is an <hi>Adam</hi> for purity, and ſoundneſs of Conſtitution: and how ſhall we do to account for the Apoſtaſie of ſo many <hi>Adams,</hi> if we be puzled at the Fall of one?</p>
                  <p>But alas! The myſterious Intricacy of this, is not ſo great, but that the manifeſt evidence of the matter of Fact is as great. It is enough, Ah Lord, it is more than enough, to know and ſee (which indeed we cannot hide our eyes from) that this noble Vine is turned into a degenerate Plant;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107613:120"/> That the Native Friends and Favorites of God are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Lovers, yea, Servants, yea, Worſhippers of the World. And the greatneſs of their Number is too too evident in theſe <hi>Meditations;</hi> which yet I am ſenſible have not deſcribed all. Some, poſſibly, will think theſe too many: I cannot help it; but the Diſcovery is in order to their Recovery. Others, poſſibly, in another Extreme, will think theſe too few; and will extend the predominant Love of the World further than I do or dare.</p>
                  <p>Some are ſo fierce, that every Body muſt needs be carnal, and corrupt, and of a worldly mind, who is not exactly of their mind, but of ſome Way, Perſuaſion or Opinion different from them. Theſe cry, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan:</hi> And why Satan? Why, becauſe thou ſavoureſt not our Things, our Doctrine, our Diſcipline, our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, our Way. Theycry to every one that does not pleaſe them, <hi>Thou Child of the Devil.</hi> And why, <hi>Child of the Devil,</hi> I pray? Not becauſe <hi>they pervert the right ways of the Lord;</hi> but becauſe they oppoſe their Ways, and weaken their Party. True indeed, Hereſie and Schiſm are works of the Fleſh, and ſymptoms of a worldly mind: But they are very cunning, cloſe Things, which are very hard to be diſcern'd, and of ſo lubricous a conſideration, that it is very difficult to hit of them right: So difficult, that even the inſpired Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of Heaven have been miſtaken for Emiſſaries of Hell, and the very Pillars of the Church caſt out of the Church for Hereſie. I believe Perverſneſs is a very Deviliſh Temper: But it is very unreaſonable, without any more ado, to judge every man perverſe, that does not (perhaps he cannot) in all things think as I do, or whom my Arguments cannot convince.</p>
                  <p>Some are ſo conceited of their own extraordinary Purity, that they look down with a diſdainful pity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107613:120"/> all the reſt of miſerable Mortality, as if they were all irrecoverably loſt, and themſelves, with <hi>Job</hi>'s Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, left alone to tell it. A perſon of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s Infallibility indeed may ſay, <hi>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedneſs.</hi> But for a Company of <hi>Phariſees,</hi> impregnated with Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, to conclude that all the world were <hi>born in ſin,</hi> but themſelves, and that all the vulgar ſort of Mortals are ignorant and accurſed. This, I ſay, the Candor of Heaven it ſelf could not endure. <hi>Luke 16. 15. Ye are they that juſtifie your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Pſeudocathariſts</hi> in the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 5. cry to their Neighbors, <hi>Stand off, come not near me; for I am holier than thou;</hi> Sanctificabo te, <hi>I ſhall ſanctifie thee;</hi> that is, <hi>defile thee,</hi> as that word is often uſed: As if he ſhould ſay, If thou touch me who am ſo holy, thou ſhalt be defiled, and guilty before God, as thoſe common perſons were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, who touch'd the Altar, the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or any holy thing which they ought not to touch.</p>
                  <p>Some are ſo ſevere, as to determine flatly againſt the Salvation of all <hi>Rich men,</hi> becauſe Chriſt has declared it very difficult; and to think not any of them are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Not many.</hi> And the Grandees for wit and wealth are meet with them, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Theſe poor people are fooliſh,</hi> (Jer. 5. 4.) <hi>they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God; they know not the Law, and are curſed.</hi>

                  <p>Others paſs hard Cenſures upon all Heathen Men, yea, and upon Chriſtian Unbaptized Infants too; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or falſe I know not, but I could wiſh they were falſe, and the Learning of ſome more charitable Divines has endeavor'd to prove them not true.</p>
                  <p>There are others beſides all theſe, who (though perhaps out of no bad Principle) are ready to judge
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107613:121"/> many things to be Symptoms of a predominant Love of the World, which are not. It is true, the Love of the World is ſo dangerous and pernicious, that it ought to be the conſtant care of every awakened Soul to flie from it: and one would almoſt pardon the ſcrupuloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fear of thoſe that run away from it, though they ſhould be ſuppos'd to run too far. And the Love of God is ſo pure and divine a thing, ſo great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that the exerciſe of it admits of no Exceſs: if the whole Soul were turn'd into a pure flame of Love, it would not be a Sacrifice too coſtly or precious, to be offer'd up to that ever bleſſed Being, the Supreme Good; neither would there be any room for the envy of Hell it ſelf, to put in a <hi>quorſum perditio haec.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though it admits of no Exceſs, yet I conceive it admits of Miſtakes; and though Men cannot outdo in it, yet they may do amiſs about it. As I conceive they do, (how pardonable ſoever their miſtake is) who condemn them for Lovers of the World, who do any works of Neceſſity, Charity, or common Civility upon the Lords day; who think oftner of the world, than they do of God; or who in their practice ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prefer a worldly buſineſs that is important, before a Sermon or a Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Devotion it ſelf, how excellent a thing it is, may be irregular; and there needs judgment, as well as affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to denominate a Man a right Chriſtian; without which, even the higheſt perfections of Love and Zeal do degenerate into ſomething worſe than the Notation of the words do import.</p>
                  <p>And although I do reckon that it is highly laudable and reaſonable to live in continual wearineſs of this world and life, and holy longings after the preſence of God, endeavouring to attain to the Reſurrection of the dead, yet I do not believe but there are many languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107613:121"/> and fainting Fits that befal the moſt devout Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Father here in the Body. Neither dare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> condemn every man for a predominant Lover of the World, who in ſome Paſſion, ſome Temptation or other, has almoſt loſt his ſight and taſte of God, and caſts a fond eye upon this Life and World as wretched as it is. It is beſt to wiſh with <hi>Paul, to be diſſolv'd.</hi> It is next beſt to groan with <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. It is pious to keep up a predominant eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Heaven, and to make the main buſineſs of our Lives, a doing of God's Will, and a preparation for his Kingdom: But yet I dare not conclude it to be a Symptom of predominant worldly Love, when I hear <hi>David</hi> crying in ſome caſe, <hi>O ſpare me a little, &amp;c.</hi> For when we urge the predominant Love of God as abſolutely neceſſary, we do not mean by predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that it ſhould be in the ſtricteſt ſenſe <hi>perfect</hi> The Love of the meaneſt Saint is <hi>predominant,</hi> and the Love of the devouteſt is <hi>imperfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many other miſtakes about the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Love of the World, which are occaſionally met with and corrected in the aforegoing <hi>Meditations.</hi>

                  <p>IT is too too evident that the many ſorts of perſons, before nam'd, are in the judgment of God Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the World, even all that prefer the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, pleaſures, Honours, Perſons, Buſineſs, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of the World before God; that is, before Righteouſneſs, Truth, Peace, Publick Good, Holy Order, Charity, Purity, and the Sacred Will of God.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe there are really many of theſe that will not yet acknowledge themſelves to be ſuch; let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine a little more cloſely, to find out, if poſſibly, who they are that lie under this black character, and to whom it doth agree.

                  </p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:107613:123"/>
                  <p>And here, methinks, I hear a Generation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical</hi> People (whether <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> it matters not) bleſſing themſelves, and ſaying, It is apparent that they, of all People in the World, are no Lovers of it: They are ſo far from coveting the Riches of the World, that they give away all they have, and reject the kindneſs of thoſe that would give them more: They embrace <hi>Poverty</hi> as a great <hi>Perfection,</hi> and <hi>Nak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dneſs</hi> as an <hi>Ornament.</hi> It was a high Character of them, <hi>That took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods:</hi> But what <hi>Perfectioniſts</hi> are theſe, that ſpoil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> were mortified men, who reckoned two Coats ſuperfluous, but theſe Evangeliſts are even weary of the Incumbrance of one. Nay, they ſeem to out-vie the Son of Man himſelf, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>That he had not whereon to lay his Head:</hi> As if he ſtood in need of ſome Houſe, or Artificial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; whereas the cold Earth everywhere affords theſe hardy Soldiers of his a ſufficient Bed, and the ſpangled Heavens a Canopy.</p>
                  <p>To all which great Pretenſions, I only ſuggeſt theſe two or three Inquiries,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is highly reaſonable, that theſe Pretenders to a Contempt of Worldly Riches, do inquire into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Whether in Deed, and in Truth, they do what they ſeem to do? Whether there be no Fallacy, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, or Juggle in this Matter? For we have read of thoſe that pretended to part with all to the Church; who yet kept back for their own dear ſelves, and by laying their money at the Apoſtles feet, ſeem'd to trample it under their own; who yet, for all their ſeeming Faith, and Contempt of the World, did not ſo ſtrip themſelves of all, but that they kept a Rag for a ſore Finger; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> are Examples.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:107613:123"/>2. It may be proper to inquire, Whether ſome of the Heathens themſelves, whom you ſo undervalue as the Refuſe of men, have not done as much as all this comes to? This I take for granted, according to the Logick of Divinity it ſelf, that it is but a ſorry Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in a Chriſtian, that does not excel all that can be found in a Heathen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 32. If they ſeek after theſe and theſe things, it becomes Chriſtians to ſeek after higher; if they do ſuch and ſuch things, it behoves Chriſtians to do greater.</p>
                  <p>Now, I ſuppoſe, it is an eaſie thing to find many men as perfectly and voluntarily poor amongſt the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> as amongſt <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> amongſt the <hi>Cynicks,</hi> as well as the <hi>Hermits;</hi> as much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, to any mans thinking, in a <hi>Tub,</hi> as in a <hi>Cloyſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid, Theſe men did not neglect the World out of a pure deſign; therefore</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will not be amiſs, that theſe Chriſtian Contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the World do examine their Principles and Ends; for if this voluntary caſting away of the World be only a Trick to draw and convert the eyes of the World to themſelves, and to procure an eſtimation of mortifi'd men; or a piece of Bribery to merit, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the Rewards of Heaven; or a deſign to get Riches, by a pretended Contempt of them; or a Cloak for Idleneſs, that they may eat and drink of the Beſt without doing any thing for it; chuſing rather to eat their Bread in the ſweat of other mens Brows, than of their own: If any ſuch things as theſe, I ſay hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, all this Contempt of the World is ſpoiled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes contemptible in the eyes of God; nay, indeed, it proves to be a Device for the more effectual main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Worldly Life: And who knows but that it may ſo happen, or rather, who knows not that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107613:124"/> it does? Contempt of the World muſt be impartial and regular, or elſe it will not paſs for Devotion. And if a man predominantly love the World in any branch of it, he's juſtly denominated a <hi>Lover of the World,</hi> however he may ſeem to deſpiſe it in many other bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it. It is a ſorry ſhift to endeavor to be thought to deſpiſe the Riches of the World, and in the mean time to be enſlaved to worldly Eaſe and Idleneſs; to ſome men it is the greateſt ſenſual pleaſure in the World to do nothing.</p>
                  <p>Has not the ſame God, who commanded us not to covet, nor love the World, alſo commanded to work, and get our Livings? Oh but they have ſpiritual Work to do: What Merchant ſo induſtrious as they, that compaſs Sea and Land to make Proſelytes? And did not <hi>Paul</hi> abound in this Work of the Lord, as much as any that pretend to an imitation of him? yet he made his own hands adminiſter to his Neceſſities, rather than be chargeable to the Churches; though I ſuppoſe the Churches then, were as free and as kind-hearted as they are now.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, As a man may give away all his Goods to feed the Poor, and yet have no Charity; ſo we may caſt away the World, and yet not rightly contemn it; and to a wiſe Obſerver ſhew himſelf to be more a Fool; or a Fanatick, than a Saint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good God, Since the World is ſo manifeſt, grant that I may be mortify'd to one Branch of it as well as another; that I may not maintain the Worldly Life in one ſenſe, whilest I ſeem to deſtroy it in another; that I may not cleave to the Golden Calves, nor haunt the High Places, whilest I ſeem to renounce</hi> Aſhtaroth; <hi>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lls us, That there may be many No-Virgins, whoſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:107613:125"/> Bodies are yet untouch'd; as if it were not ſo much the Conjunction of two Bodies, as of two Minds, that made a Marriage, or worſe. It's not enough not to have known a Man: <hi>Virginity</hi> is a tender thing, and may be ſpoil'd, even by ſome kind of ſeeing a Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that looks upon a Woman to luſt after her, defiles himſelf; and She that looks upon a Man, violates her <hi>Virginity:</hi> And now I wiſh our Virgins, both Males and Females, be not ſhrunk again, as much as the fore-named Captains Soldiers at the ſecond Tryal, who fell from Ten Thouſand, to Three Hundred. Yea, and it is further to be wiſht, that of this little Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that is left, of thoſe that have not known, nor ſeen any one of the other Sex, the reſt have not, at ſome time or other heard of them, read of them, or thought of them, otherwiſe than becomes them, and ſo be not like the Three Hundred Soldiers even now nam'd, that carry'd Lamps within their Veſſels, I mean, that burn, though they marry not.</p>
                  <p>And now, methinks, I could find in my heart to grant, that if the Claim to this pure, perfect, unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unſullied <hi>Virginity</hi> be juſt, it is concluſive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am very confident it's not juſt.</p>
                  <p>But yet it will not be amiſs to inquire, Whether this unſpotted <hi>Chaſtity</hi> be accompany'd with the profound Self-Examination, and entire Self-Reſignation, and eſpecially with that Divine Charity that it ought? The <hi>true Virgin</hi> is the Soul that chaſtely adheres to God the bleſſed Being, whoſe Name is <hi>Love.</hi> And ſhe is an Adulterous Soul that cheriſhes Wicked Hatred, as well as ſhe that allows Wanton Love. What if I do not burn in unlawful Love, if I burn in Hatred, and be inflam'd with Revenge, I have defiled my Soul, and loſt my Purity in the ſight of God. The High Prieſts would not defile themſelves by the Judgment
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:107613:126"/> Hall, but with Envy and Murder they would: Or what if this pure Virgin flie from all Mortal Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea, and loath the ſight and thoughts of any man, if ſhe ſettle into a Self-admiration, fondly doting upon her own Beauty or Virginity, or Wantonly dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her own Fortitude or Perfections, ſhe has play'd the Whore from God, (who alone ought to be Supreme in the Soul) and is become unchaſte in her Amours.</p>
                  <p>It may be very pertinent to examine, Whether a great part of the Virginity that is found in the World; be not meerly <hi>Conſtitutional;</hi> it's no thanks to them not to Burn, who are not Combuſtible: Another great part <hi>Political,</hi> when People live ſingle, meerly that they may live. It was accounted bad Devotion in <hi>Saul,</hi> when he forced himſelf, and offered a Sacrifice. And how ſhall ſhe be accounted an acceptable Virgin, who, though ſhe flies from other men, forces her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pure Virginity</hi> is indeed a Delicate and Divine Thing, if it be any where to be found; but this does not at all diſparage Conjugal Love juſtly placed, and purely exerciſed and obſerved: Nay, I do verily think that there is as much or more Chaſtity to be found in a Conjugal ſtate, as in a Single. To the Conjugal Bed it is that the Apoſtle gives the Epithete of <hi>undefiled:</hi> I wiſh the Virgins can any of them ſay as much of theirs, more, I'm ſure, they cannot. I will allow a pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſtate to be excellent, perhaps more excellent than a Conjugal; but it's enough for the Conjugal to be accounted Honourable, and that is in plain terms by the holy Author of it, God himſelf. But whatever excellencies in ſome ſenſe or other may be found in the Virgin ſtate, yet I hope its Virgin modeſty is ſuch, as will forbid it to vie with the Conjugal for uſefulneſs, which I'm ſure is one famous <hi>ſpecies</hi> of excellency:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:107613:126"/> And indeed for goodneſs, or excellency in general, I cannot ſee how that can be bad now, which even in the ſtate of Innocency it ſelf was declared to be good, Gen. 2. <hi>It is good for man to have a wife.</hi>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. III.</hi> Of the Votaries of Penance.</head>
                  <p>AS for the Votaries of Penance, though it may well be doubted whether they feel a ſmart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the ſhrugs and ſowre faces that they make; and though it may be charitably ſuppos'd that they ſuſtain themſelves very well with rich cordials and good fare, whereby many Pilgrimages of an hundred or two hundred miles long become leſs troubleſome to them than many a poor mans journey or labour of a day, and ſo their pretenſions are not juſt; yet ſuppoſe all to be true that is pretended, how will it certainly conclude a contempt of the World.</p>
                  <p>For will not <hi>Diogenes</hi> amongſt the Heathens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to as much neglect of the pleaſures of the World, and the eaſe of the fleſh, by lying in his Tub, as any body can do by travelling abroad bare-foot, and bare-leg'd. Will not the Diſciples of the Phariſees put in for the ſeverity of frequent Faſts, and match the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> outdoe the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> And will not the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> put in for a ſhare of the honour due to Laſhing and Slaſhing Devotion as well as any Goſpel Prieſts? There will never be any firm and comfortable inference, ſo long as it may be required what do you more than others, thoſe none of the beſt neither? So then the Enquiry will be, at whoſe command, out of what principle, for what end, all theſe ſeverities are executed. If any of theſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107613:127"/> fail, the contempt of the World is but a pretence. And who knows not but that the worſhip of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and of the Baalitiſh Jews too, perform'd with ſo much ſmart and ſacred horror, is accounted of God and all good men, ſlaviſhly ſuperſtitious, and a hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will-worſhip. If the Principle out of which all theſe ſeverities are perform'd, be ſo pure as it ought, it will produce an uniform ſelf-denial, and holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and a contempt of the World in all the branches of it, as well as in the pleaſures; ſo that if there be not an Humility, Charity, Faith, Hope, Zeal, anſwerable to theſe bodily exerciſes, they will profit nothing. If a man give his body to be burnt and in the mean time have a mind to burn his Brother, he is no Martyr, no nor Saint neither.</p>
                  <p>And may not the Worldly Life be maintain'd, and cheriſht in the acts of Self-love, Self-ſeeking, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence, Pride, and Self-feeling, amidſt all this abſtemiouſneſs, and theſe ſeverities excercis'd upon the body.</p>
                  <p>Yea, what if all theſe things ſhould be nothing but to bribe the Juſtice of God, to tye the hands of his vengeance, to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of ones one, to purchaſe by merit a ſorry carnal kind of heaven merely external and future. If ſo then they are ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of a ſlaviſh and ſuperſtitious, but are utterly inconſiſtent with a holy and religious mind. And who knows not but that all this may be, yea and evey diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſtian does vehemently ſuſpect that it often is.</p>
                  <p>From hence, O my Soul, take an occaſion to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that thou as to thy natural Capacity art able to act without the help of the fleſh, and without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance thereupon; and conſequently capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſins of the Spirit as well as ſins of the Fleſh,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107613:127"/> however in a lax ſenſe, whatever is contrary to God may in Scripture be call'd fleſh, and ſo all ſins may be call'd Works of Fleſh. When thou haſt laid aſide this Fleſh, thou canſt not reaſonably think of, nor patiently endure to think of a long ſleep, till the time that thou ſhalt re-aſſume it; and if after thy releaſe from Fleſh, thou ſhalt ſtill be able to act, then ſure it may be fairly concluded, that even ſome of thy Acts, even whil'ſt thou art in the Body, are purely ſpiritual, and do little or nothing depend upon the Body.</p>
                  <p>Though thou canſt not be guilty of Adultery, or Drunkenneſs, without the help of the Body, yet it is no fault of the Body, or a very remote one, that thou art proud, ſelf-will'd, unbelieving, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable. All filthy and unrenewed Souls will not be the leſs, but rather much more ſuch, by leaving the Fleſh. Diſtinguiſh therefore carefully between the ſins of the Fleſh, and of the Spirit; and reckon that thy firm and chaſte adherence to the ever bleſſed God thy Centre, and entire Reſignation of thy ſelf to him, is thy Virginity, and much to be preferr'd before Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Continency. What if thou have kept thy hands from picking and ſtealing, if in the mean time by Pride thou rob God of his Honour, or by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief Chriſt of his Glory, How art thou honeſt? What if thou haſt not ſmitten with the Fiſt of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs or Violence, if by Self-Will thou have Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly contended againſt the Authority of Heaven, and ſecretly oppoſed the Will of God, How art thou Loyal? What if thou have not proſtituted any of thy fleſhly Members to Adulterous Aſpects or Embraces, yet if thou have in a way of Self-love fondly admired and wantonly dallied with thy own Perfections, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinct from God, How art thou Chaſte? What if thou haſt ſo ſeverely chaſtiſed the Body, that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107613:128"/> thou may'ſt ſeem to have battered the Out-works of Sin, yet if it ſtill lodge in the Caſtle of thy Heart, if thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If thou think by Penance to commute for true Converſion and Repen ance, as men by money commute for Penance, thou art in the worſt ſenſe Simoniacal, and it will be ſaid to thee, <hi>Thy Penance periſh with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord, Make me to feel the mighty power of Holy Religion upon my Soul, ſubjecting it to thy Authority, reconciling it to thy Will, uniting it to thy Perfection, and conſorming it to thy Purity; purging me from all ſecret Selfiſhneſs, cleanſing me from all Hypocriſie, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, Pride, and Sacrilegious Conceits of my own Worthineſs!

                     <hi>MEDITAT. IV.</hi> Of Quakers.</head>
                  <p>FRom theſe <hi>Falſe Deſpiſers of Pleaſures,</hi> I will now proceed to conſider a generation of men that pretend to be mighty Lovers of God, inaſmuch as they reject and undervalue the Honours of the World. For as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107613:128"/> the predominant love of honour will certainly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a man a Lover of the World, ſo it ſeems that the juſt contempt of it ſhould argue a Lover of God. And here, though there be many pretenders, yet the People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> ſeem to be the moſt famous ſpecies. I beg their pardon that I call them <hi>Quakers</hi> (which name they ſeem not to relliſh well) for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I do it not out of a way of reproach, but merely for diſtinction ſake. I confeſs I do not know what the <hi>proprium quarto modo</hi> of a <hi>Quak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r</hi> is; for he has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things common with other ſeparates, and with other men that are not ſeparates, ſo that I ſahll not meddle with him under any conſideration, but this, of undervaluing the World, expreſt either in words, actions, or faſhions, becauſe he pretends more to this, then any ſort of men that I can think of, and yet herein I will not judge him neither, but in kindneſs put him upon judging of himſelf. And I will digeſt my Meditations into this order, Firſt briefly lay down as far as I know the <hi>Quakers</hi> judgment and moſt general practice about this matter. Secondly, ſhew what Authority or Argument he brings for it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, examine the ſtrength of thoſe Arguments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Anſwers may be given to them. And Laſtly, ſuggeſt ſome things whereby he may try his ſincerity and ſpirituality in this matter.</p>
                  <p>I will willingly grant by way of Premiſe, that Worldly Honour, Reſpect and Applauſe are very dear and grateful to the Animal Life and Fleſhly Mind; ſo dear, that he does prefer it before the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of God and the witneſs of a good Conſcience. I do grant that to love the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God, is a ſymptom of a Phariſaical and Hypocritical Perſon.</p>
                  <p>That all Honour in a Scripture ſenſe is due to God,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107613:129"/> and that all the glory of men is nothing but a reflection of Divine Glory.</p>
                  <p>That the proper honour conſiſts in due eſtimation, and reverence of mind, and that the external expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it by words of geſtures are leſs properly called Honour.</p>
                  <p>That it's an Argument of a weak, corrupt and carnal mind, to honour thoſe whom he knows to be unworthy of Honours, to Bleſs thoſe whom God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors.</p>
                  <p>That it's a great perfection to be mortified to the ſenſe and expectation of Worldly Honour, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and Applauſe, and Reſpect of men, and an excellent Chriſt like Attainment and Fortitude, to be able rightly to bear contempt, and in no degree to complain of unjuſt neglect.</p>
                  <p>And now I ſhall proceed to the firſt Head which I propound to my ſelf in this Meditation, <hi>viz.</hi> Which is the <hi>Quakers</hi> Judgement and moſt general Practice about this matter. I think indeed they are not all agreed (whether it be becauſe ſome are leſs perfect then others, or becauſe ſome are more deluded then others, I know not) but yet their moſt receiv'd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is that they ought not to give honour to men: And yet this they moſtly limit to External Honour, for I never met with any of them that ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be lov'd, to be eſteem'd well of, and to be valued according to his Worth or Wealth either.</p>
                  <p>And ſo with them the bowing of the body in a way of Reverence looks like Idolatry, the putting off the Hat is Superſtitious, the giving Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is Carnal, and ſo much as to thank the Fellow creature is at beſt vain; and ſo are all Worldly Faſhions in Apparel, Complements in words, Civil diſtinction, and the like.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. V.</hi> Of the Quakers Arguments.</head>
                  <p>FOR this ſerve kind of denying of Honours and Faſhions of the World, they alledge many plain Precepts, and Noble Examples: Neither will I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, there ſeems to be a great deal to be ſaid for it.</p>
                  <p>They will tell you, That as to this matter, the great <hi>Moſes</hi> was a <hi>Quaker</hi> as much as they, when he refus'd to be call'd, <hi>The Son of</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>Daughter;</hi> preferr'd the Profeſſion of a deſpis'd Religion with the profeſſed <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> before the worldly Honor of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court; when he undervalued his own Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for a Prophet, and would not ingroſs that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to himſelf, but was deſirous that all the Lord's People ſhould ſhare in it; when he married an <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Woman at a time when he might have had Rich and Noble Matches, and took ſo meekly the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reflections that his Brother and Siſter had made upon him, for his ſo great undervaluing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame ſpirit was the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> who treated the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as like a <hi>Quaker</hi> as ever you heard: 2 Kings 3. 12, 14. <hi>What have I to do with thee? Get thee to the Prophets of thy Father, and of thy Mother.</hi> And he ſwears, (and therein he ſeems to be leſs perfect than a <hi>Quaker) As the Lord liveth, Were it not that I regard the preſence of the King of</hi> Judah, <hi>I would not look at thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Somewhat like this freedom of Spirit, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Speech, void of Compliment, and Courtly Reſpect of Perſons, may be found in the Story of all
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107613:130"/> the Prophets, almoſt from <hi>Samuel,</hi> down to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And leſt this ſhould be thought to be only an unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Old Teſtament Spirit, they come as near to the Goſpel Times as may be, and quote the <hi>Baptist,</hi> a greater than whom the Daughters of Men had not born; whoſe plain and unfaſhionable Dreſs, and Diet, ſevere Converſation, and uncomplimental Uſage of all ſorts of men, even <hi>Herod</hi> the King, and the Viperous Generation of the Formal <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they fanſie does much reſemble and juſtifie the <hi>Evangelical Quaker.</hi> They think they reſemble him in his Looks and Doctrine, and Life, and ſay, They would not ſtick to be Conformable to him in his Death too. But if <hi>John</hi> ſeem alſo to have a little too much of the ſowreneſs of the Law in him, and ſo his Example ſhould be rejected, they hope the Author of the Goſpel, and his moſt intimate Friends and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Followers, will juſtifie their Spirit and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p>The ſharp Anſwer that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſent to <hi>Herod,</hi>(the Fox) the plain Reprehenſions that he gave to the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, Blind, and Superſtitious <hi>Phariſees,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their great Authority in the Church; his poor and harmleſs way of Living; his diſowning of Relations, in compariſon of the Doers of the Will of God; his free and friendly Converſe with the Pooreſt, and the Worſt too, in order to their good; ſhews how little of Statelineſs, or compliment, or worldly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects was in him.

                  <p>I Suppoſe we are all agreed thus far, That when the Scripture forbids, or ſeems to forbid giving or receiving of Honour, it cannot be underſtood of the real, proper, inward Honour, which is no other than Reverence, or due Eſtimation, and is little elſe than the Love that we bear to a Superior. The Text has commanded us expreſly, <hi>To honour our Parents, to honour the King, to honour all Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This muſt be underſtood at the leaſt of this inward Honour and Reverence, which indeed is primarily due to God, <hi>The Father of Lights;</hi> but ſecondarily, and for his ſake, to men alſo, to whom he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated moſt of himſelf. And according to this greater or leſſer Communication of himſelf. I ſuppoſe our Honour or Eſtimation of men ought to be greater or leſſer. And ſo conſequently we are all agreed, That there is no real Honour due, where there is no real Worth or Excellency: And to eſteem Perſons unduly, is an Imperfection in the Judgment, and a Departure from Truth, which muſt needs be Evil.</p>
                  <p>But the Excellency and Worthineſs that God gives to men is of ſeveral ſorts, <hi>Natural, Political, Moral, Supernatural,</hi> and all theſe the Objects of Honour: So that there is an Honour due to Parents, though they be never ſo unkind; to Kings and Magiſtrates, though they be bad men; to a Moraliſt, although he never heard of Chriſt; and eſpecially to the Saints, though they be never ſo poor, and otherwiſe unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht, by reaſon of the ſupernatural Worth that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107613:132"/> God has communicated to them. And becauſe the Image of God in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and True Holineſs, is the moſt excellent Communication of God to Man, therefore the Saints are in the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts Phraſe the Excellent of the earth, and the greateſt honour is due to them upon that account; let Chriſt Jeſus himſelf be Judge, who eſteem'd the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral excellency of them that did the Will of God, more then the natural excellency of all relations accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fleſh: and let his Apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> be Judge, who honoured Chriſt himſelf more upon a ſpiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, than upon any fleſhly conſideration whatever (<hi>though we have known Chriſt after the Fleſh,</hi>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>) The Controverſie then will be about the external and leſs proper honour, or rather the outward expreſſion of honour by words or geſtures. That there may and ought to be ſuch expreſſions of honour according to the different Cuſtom of different Countreys is plain, both by Precept and Example; To riſe up before the Hoary is expreſly commanded, and it is made the ſame with honouring of Old Men, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 32. The relieving of Parents is accounted an honouring of them by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 10. And the paying of Tribute is an external expreſſion of honour that is due to Kings, and it's expreſly required, <hi>For this cauſe pay ye Tribute alſo,</hi> &amp;c. It is needleſs, and it would be almoſt endleſs to record all the Examples of the Wiſe and Holy Men in Scripture, that do juſtify the giving and receiving expreſſions of honour, in words and geſtures.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we reaſonably imagine that all Nations and Ages of the World are bound to the very ſame expreſſions of honour, which the Jews uſed, or thoſe Ages of the World that the Scripture writes the Hiſtory of. If the Jews fall flat before a Prince or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:107613:132"/> and we only kneel before them, we are not more Complimental than they, but leſs. There is leſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion or appearance of Worſhip, in giving the right Hand of Fellowſhip, and putting off the Hat, which we uſe, than there is in their Bowings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of old, which were ſo common amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>And as for Verbal Expreſſions of Honour, we are no more Complimental than the beſt of men have ever been, in commending things well done, and praiſing them that do them, in praying for the long Life and Proſperity of Kings and Magiſtrates, in ſaluting our Neighbours, and wiſhing them, <hi>A Good Day,</hi> or, <hi>Good Speed,</hi> inquiring after their Welfare, rejoycing in it, or thanking them for their Good Will, or any Good Turn. That very Apoſtle who ſo often <hi>gave Thanks to God the Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> does not boggle to <hi>give Thanks to his Fellow-creatures, Rom.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
                  <p>This, I think, is enough to juſtifie the ſober uſe of theſe Civilities in Words and Geſtures, which they call Complimenrs: But I do not think any thing of this does juſtifie the Hypocriſie, Falſity, Flattery, and either undue or exceſſive Expreſſions of Reſpect, which all ſober men do complain of, as well as the <hi>Quakers.</hi> And oh would to God we were all ſo Wiſe and Righteous, as to Honour and Reſpect all men agreeably to their real Worth; and ſo ſimple and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, as to uſe only ſuch outward Expreſſions, as for their Nature and Degree, are agreeable to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour!</p>

                     </gap>ain kind of Honour that was offered him at one time, as being upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inconſiſtent with the Religious courſe he had entred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet at other times we read that he was very much honour'd by the People, and it was the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God that he ſhould be honour'd by them. God himſelf did magnifie him in the ſight of all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I believe he eſteem'd it as great an Honour to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Son of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s Daughter; and to lead and feed ſo great a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo miraculouſly in the Wilderneſs, as to live in the Pomp and Eaſe of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court. As for the Inſtances that are brought out of the Behaviour of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who would not vouchſafe his Cap and Knee to the proud <hi>Agagite;</hi> of <hi>Eliſhah,</hi> who would not vouchſafe a Look to the wicked King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> By that time ſomething be allow'd to the Conſtitution of theſe men, ſomething to their extraordinary Spirit, and ſomething to the extraordinarineſs of their Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially the former, the Argument from hence will be very much moderated: And when it ſhall be obſerv'd, that theſe very men at other times both gave Honour to men, and themſelves receiv'd great Honour
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107613:133"/> from men, as is very evident in their ſtory, it will appear that they were no <hi>Quakers</hi> in this point. In the mean time I confeſs I could heartily wiſh that this civil reſpect might not be ſo indifferently beſtow'd, and proſtituted, by being made common to all men alike both good and bad. For if all men profeſſing the Goſpel, were of that purity and fortitude as becomes them, and ſo free from folly and flattery, ſlaviſhneſs and partiality, as the true Spirit of the Goſpel requires, there would be a great diſtinction between the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the vile, in honour, and all expreſſions of it; although there would be a juſt reſpect kept up to all men with relation had to their authority; which is ſomething divine. For honour ought to be agreeable to the worth, and it's reaſonable to think, that the outward Expreſſions of Honour which we ſhew, ought to be proportionable to the Honour we bear: otherwiſe we ſhall be chargeable with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Hypocriſie, Flattery, or Partiality, which the Simplicity of the Goſpel knows not.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Baptist</hi> indeed was an auſtere man (a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarite</hi>) but his particular Faſhion of Apparel, and his way of Diet, and Converſe, were not intended to be an Example to the reſt of the World; for neither did his Lord and Maſter conform to his Guiſe, (<hi>John came neither eating nor drinking</hi>) nor yet do the <hi>Quakers</hi> themſelves, take themſelves bound to gird themſelves as he did, nor with him, to feed upon Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts and wild Honey.</p>
                  <p>If they imitate him in the Doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it's no other than what every Evangelical Miniſter will conſent to be a <hi>Quaker</hi> in as well as they only perhaps he will not be content to preach it ſo Nakedly, as they do ſometimes, and as I my ſelf have ſeen them.</p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:107613:134"/>
                  <p>As for that familiar Phraſe and plain Reprehenſions which both the <hi>Baptist</hi> and <hi>Christ Jeſus</hi> uſed toward <hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> let all Divines that have the ſame underſtanding in Points of Divinity, and the ſame Spirit of diſcerning Hearts, be as plain and as poſitive as they. And oh that the ſmooth Flatteries, and colloguing Addreſſes of many Miniſters, did not ſo much tempt the <hi>Quakers</hi> to a contrary Extreme, of handling men Rudely, and without any Reſpect to their Civil Quality, as they do at this day!</p>
                  <p>As for the familiar Converſe that Chriſt held with the worſt ſort of men for their Edification, his loving and undiſdainful Behaviour to the Poor, his valuing of all Perſons according to their real Worth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ſpiritual Cognation before the Carnal, I would to God we were all thus far <hi>Quakers,</hi> I mean, faithful Followers of his Humility, Patience, Zeal, Charity, and Compaſſion! which I doubt not but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are as much, or more, than theſe that call themſelves <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what ſhall I ſay to the plain Commands of not being call'd <hi>Rabbi,</hi> of not calling any man <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Maſter</hi> upon Earth, of ſitting down in the <hi>lowest places</hi> at Feaſts, and the like. Why, I have this to ſay, That they are not plain Commands, nor muſt they be underſtood in the plaineſt and moſt literal ſenſe: It is not fair for the <hi>Quakers</hi> to make Chriſt ſpeak for them, ſo as to make him ſpeak againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Paſſages can no way be underſtood to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of not giving and receiving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for we know Chriſt himſelf was called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and commends, elſewhere, the good Manners of his Diſciples, in calling him <hi>Maſter:</hi> And when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaks of mens Natural Parents, he calls them their.

                  <p>This Charity is very Commendable, eſpecially when we conſider, how moſt Great Men ſpend their Eſtates.</p>
                  <p>But it's more highly Commendable in thoſe that have Children of their own, and who in their Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time part with ſo conſiderable a ſhare of their Eſtates to Charitable Uſes.</p>
                  <p>But yet even amongſt theſe, the Love of the World may be found predominant. A Worldly Heart may be found not only amongſt them that ſquander away their Eſtates prodigally, and all they have in Riotous Living, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 13. But even amongſt them, that beſtow all their Goods to feed the Poor, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. It was a plauſible Argument that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> uſed to our Saviour, when they argu'd, <hi>That a certain Gentleman loved their Nation, becauſe he had built them a Synag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>How Plauſible and Commendable ſoever therefore the Charity of theſe great Benefactors may be, yet if
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107613:137"/> any ſuch Benefactor deſign, and provide for the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, and Perpetuation of his own Name, more than the Advancement of the Name of God, and the Propagation of Religion and Virtue in the World, he will be found ultimately to ſacrifice to that great Idol Self-Intereſt, and not to God.</p>
                  <p>If any ſuch Benefactor build up Churches of Stone, and at the ſame time, hate, demoliſh, or neglect the Living Temples of God, and love not his Saints above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, it's but like the ſilly mockery of thoſe whom the Goſpel expoſes to Contempt, that honor'd the Dead Prophets with many outward Shews, and in the mean time perſecuted the Living to death. Or if any rob <hi>Peter,</hi> to gratifie <hi>Paxl;</hi> Build Almſ houſes, out of the Alms that they have kept back out of the gain of Oppreſſion and Uſury. It's poſſible a man may build and endow Schools for the Inſtruction of others, and yet himſelf remain in a ſtate of Ignorance not caring to know, not ſo much as the neceſſary things that belong unto his peace. That a man may build Work-houſes for others, and yet ſit down careleſs and ſlothful in the matters of his own Soul, nor take pains to work out the ſalvation thereof. That a man may provide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably for the future ſtate of Widows, and Impotent in this World, and yet make no proviſion for his own Eternity in another, and ſo (if I may allude to the Apoſtle) be poor, whil'ſt he makes many rich; or at leaſt, relieves their poverty.</p>
                  <p>All External Acts of Charity and Benificence, as well as of Devotion, are competible to the Animal Life, as well as the Divine, and may be acted over as plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to a pur-blind Obſerver, by a Self-lover, or a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the World, as by a Lover of the Father.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. X.</hi> Of the Pretenders to Righteouſneſs.</head>
                  <p>AS the Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, ſo certainly the predominant Lovers of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are Lovers of the Righteous Lord. Looking upon theſe, one cannot but love them at firſt ſight, as it's ſaid of Chriſt. This Righteouſneſs is ſuch a qualification, as without which no man can have the confidence to lay any claim to the Goſpel Character of a good man. It ſeems to be ſo famous a Species of Vertue, that it is in Scripture Tropology put for Goodneſs or Vertue in general, as Fortitude was amongſt the Heathens, <hi>Fortes creantur fortibus &amp; bonis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sacrifices were of divine inſtitution, and an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way of mens drawing nigh to God; and rightly offer'd up, were very acceptable to him, yet Charity is prefer'd before them, (<hi>I will have mercy,</hi> &amp;c.) and yet Righteouſneſs ſeems to have the precedency of Charity it ſelf. If the obligation to Juſtice be not ſtronger than the obligation to Mercy, yet it ſeems to have a priority, and requires to be firſt ſerved, if there be a competition; for Charity it ſelf looks like a kind of Felony, if it antevert Righteouſneſs, being a giving away of that which is of right another mans.</p>
                  <p>But as there are many things call'd unrighteouſneſs, which indeed deſerve not to be ſo clamor'd againſt, (which I think will fall under ſome of my future Meditations) ſo I doubt there is a great deal that is magnified for Rightouſeneſs that deſerves not to be ſo celebrated.</p>
                  <p>For ſuppoſe one of theſe pretenders to Righteouſneſs be never ſo exact in matters of dealing with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107613:138"/> Juſt in matters of Bargain, Faithful in matters of Truſt, Punctual in payment of Debts, Wages, Promiſes, if yet he be unjuſt to God in with-holding his Heart from him, to whom it is due, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the World or Carnal Self, in the higheſt Room, there he is a Lover of the World, and not of the Father; as truly as a Wife is unrighteous, who allthough ſhe does not waſte her Husbands <hi>Eſtate,</hi> yet gives <hi>her ſelf</hi> away from him, and opens her Boſom to a Stranger.</p>
                  <p>The Righteouſneſs that will Denominate a Man a lover of God, muſt be in Conjunction with Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, Charity, and Purity; If our Righteouſneſs be not ſo, it's ſome Spurious, or Mechanical thing.</p>
                  <p>But is it poſſible that a Man ſhould be thus exactly Righteous, and yet not a Lover of the Father?</p>
                  <p>Why not, That Self-love, the Lord of the World, may be the very Spring from which External Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs does flow, to be ſeen of Men, acepted of Men, to Maintain a good Reputation amongſt Men, and to have a good Credit with them, was the beſt Principle from which the Righteouſneſs of the Phariſees proceeded; which yet was as exact as moſt Men can pretend to, ſo exact, that they would not Cozen the Levite of a little <hi>Mint,</hi> or <hi>Cummin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many of theſe Righteous Men may we ſee every where, who not withſtanding their Pretenſions to Juſtice, make no Conſcience of Robbing God of the Time which he has Conſecrated for his own Service, and the Poor of that part of their Eſtates which God has Aſſigned for their uſe,</p>
                  <p>They are ſo Punctual in matter of Commutative Juſtice, that they Challenge any Man to ſay Black

                  <p>However Righteouſneſs is a lovely Character and a Character of a Lover of God, yet 'tis very neceſſary we ſhould examine well whether our Righteous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation proceed from a Righteous Principle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be univerſal and permament, and whether it be accompanied with the Faith and Charity which go for the Conſtitution of it; or whether it be not ſuperſtitiouſly deſigned as meritorious of Favor and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This indeed makes the Caſe leſs ſad, but it makes it more ſtrange.

Why poſſibly amongſt the one and the other, there may be found ſome that are Lovers of the World, more than of God.

                  <p>Now methinks, I may divide theſe diſabled perſons, as our Saviour did his <hi>Eunuchs</hi> into Three Sorts. Firſt, Such as have made themſelves <hi>Eunuchs</hi> for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp;c. Secondly, Such as are born <hi>Eunuchs.</hi> Thirdly, Such as are made <hi>Eunuchs</hi> of men: <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> out of Judgment, by vertue of Education, or out of ſome Worldly Reſpects, or Carnal Principle.</p>
                  <p>The Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> that are ſuch for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake, do not fall under my Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. That they are ſuch, themſelves do averr; and their charitable adverſaries are loth to ſuſpect, nay, they are ready to ſay of them as the Pharaſaical Scribes ſaid of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 23. 9. <hi>We find no evil in theſe men, but if a Spirit or an Angel have ſpoken to them, let us not fight against God.</hi> We find no fault with the temper or converſation of theſe men; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they be thus perſwaded in their Conſciences, let us not oppreſs or perſecute them, ſeeing the root of the matter is found in them. By what Arguments they come to be perſwaded in their Conſciences to be ſuch, I need not conſider. Themſelves have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them openly and plentifully enough, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all men know the men, and their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations.</p>
                  <p>The 2d. ſort therefore are ſuch, as are <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> by Education, (as it were from their mothers Womb) who thereby receiv'd a prejudice, before they could judge of things that differ. I do not know that there are any ſuch, but 'tis ſaid they are, and 'tis not unlikely, for we know what the former times were, and what Power, Breeding and Education has to form the Nations, and faſhion the Opinions of Men. If theſe ſhould hit of the right way, it is no thanks to them. However, not chooſing it by a mature Judgment, but being faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto by company and converſe, it cannot be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107613:140"/> ſuppos'd that they act ingenuouſly or rationally. And if there be any that give no better account of their Nonconformity then this, that they were ſo bred and ſo taught, I think they themſelves are Carnal, though the things they hold are never ſo Orthodox. It is a vain Nonconformity, as well as Converſation, that has no other gound but this, that it is receiv'd by Tradition from the Fore-Fathers. And it may truly be ſaid they Worſhip they know not what, that have nothing to ſay for their way of Worſhip, but, <hi>Our Fathers Worſhipt upon this Mountain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſay there are of the Third, ſort that are made <hi>Eunuchs</hi> of Men, that in their diſſenting are acted as Carnal men, by obſtinate humour, or worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Some ſay they are proud and wilful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited; ſome ſay they are idle, and therefore they cry, let us have our liberty, let us Sacrifice unto our God in our way. Some ſay they are obſtinate and unruly, <hi>They regard not thee O King, nor the Decree that thou haſt Sign'd.</hi> Others ſay they are acted by Worldly Intereſt, either the Intereſts of their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which by their levity they are loth to forfeit with the People; or their Eſtates, which are advanc'd and not impair'd by their ſufferings. I confeſs ſome of theſe charges ſeem to be ſtrange and almoſt incredible: Others are perhaps too true. God will judge their Hearts and Principles; in the mean time, I would they ſhould know that God does not eſtimate any Man by his Profeſſions, be they never ſo ſpecious; nor his Opinions, be they never ſo Orthodox; nor by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form, be it never ſo pure and refined. (It's eaſy, (I wiſh it be not ordinary) for man to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, in a fine Spiritual mode.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>However they may glory in their Conformity, yet ſure the Church has no cauſe to glory in them; for they are but a Company of preſt Soldiers, and will either be eaſily Routed, or Run away. Theſe love the World more than Truth, which they take no pains to diſcover; and the peace of their Conſciences, which they take no care to preſerve.</p>
                  <p>The Careleſs prefer the Cuſtome and Example of Men, before right Reaſon, Judgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and though they ſhould chance to hit of the right, yet they act wrongly. The Covetous prefer the Bread of Prieſts, before the Prieſts Office, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 36. with the degenerate Poſterity of <hi>Eli.</hi> It's fit indeed, that they that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel; but to preach the Goſpel only to get a
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:107613:142"/> Livelihood or a Living, looks like Simony inverted; a giving of holy things, to get money.</p>
                  <p>The Heathen Satyriſt laught at thoſe Mag-pie Poets, who were inſtructed by the ſound of their empty Guts; and taught Muſick, by the chiming of their own Bellies: and I cannot ſee how theſe men are leſs ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, I am ſure they are more preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>The Careleſs and Inconſiderate, though their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhould be of clean Beaſts, yet at beſt do but offer the Sacrifice of Fools. The Covetous are either Inconſiderate, and ſo they fall on, and never ſay Grace; but, like <hi>Saul's</hi> hungry Soldiers, flie upon the Spoil, and in their Hunger eat without Diſcretion, Blood and all; or elſe if they entertain any ſober thoughts, the love and cares of the World preſently ſpring up and choak them. Whether are more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, it matters not, in a Caſe where both are inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable,</p>
                  <p>But this is plain, that where a doubt lies between Truth and Falſhood, he that admits Worldly Intereſt for an Umpire to decide the Controverſie, is a Lover of the World; and if worldly Conſiderations be the predominant Motives, let the matter he embraces be never ſo true, he is falſe to his God and his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in embracing it. The Profeſſion of the Goſpel is a good thing, and yet the Profeſſion of the Goſpel is a good thing, and yet the Profeſſors of it that are acted by a carnal Principle, are nevertheleſs bad men.</p>
                  <p>As to both theſe, I will not ſay, that every Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt is carnal, that will not part with his Life, upon the ſame account as he parts with his Liberty, or Livelihood; nor that every Conformiſt is carnal, who Conforms with ſome Regret, and had much rather no ſuch things were required: yet ſurely they are fartheſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:107613:143"/> remov'd from the foul Character of Lovers of the World, whoſe Conſciences are moſt ſtrongly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and who are acted by no intereſt but the intereſts of Truth and Righteouſneſs, in what they do, or leave undone.</p>

                  <p>THE Apoſtaſie of Man, and the Depravedneſs of his preſent ſtate, has made Education neceſſary, and yet at the ſame time very painful. He is not only an Aſſes Colt for Folly, but a Wild Aſſes Colt for Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs, and Untractableneſs; ſo that it requires a great deal of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to teach him, and as much <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> in enduring ſo to do. Both which render them very honourable, and much to be rever'd by Mankind, whom God has qualifi'd for this Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it is a pity but the beſt of Men were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd herein, and the beſt of Encouragements were allow'd them. But (alas!) how few are there to be found in this Employment, that are worthy of it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that undertake to teach, have themſelves never well learn'd; and many others that are appointed to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Minds, govern the Paſſions, and form the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of others, are themſelves ſo immoral, ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſo uncultivated, that it's pity they ſhould be made Keepers of the Vineyard, when their own Vineyard they cannot keep. And beſides theſe, there are many other Corruptions crept into this Honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which do moſt evidently denominate many of theſe perſons Lovers of the World, more than of God.</p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:107613:143"/>
                  <p>What elſe are thoſe Miniſters that baptize Children into a Faith, which afterwards they take no care to make them underſtand?</p>
                  <p>What elſe are thoſe Parents that make proviſion for the Bodies, and neglect the Souls of their Children? Or thoſe Tutors, who bear the Names, and defray the Expences of their Pupils, but do not concern themſelves about their Manners; they are indeed more properly Stewards, than Tutors. What elſe are thoſe Tutors or Maſters, that being entruſted to teach Youth, do either not teach them, or teach them in a degree that bears no proportion, either to what the Subject is capable of receiving, or what reward they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do receive for inſtructing them? Or if they do skilfully and fully enough inſtruct them in Humane Learning, yet are careleſs of Divine, putting off that to the Parſon, or crying, <hi>Oh in thoſe things the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt be taught of God.</hi> Alas! what fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, what Ignorance, Error and Worldlineſs in Riper Years, is this Neglect the cauſe of! For by that time Youth has withdrawn its Hand from the Ferule, and its Back from the Rod, it's uſually ſetled in the temper that it is reſolved to be of, and ſo engaged in ſome way of Worldly Pleaſure or Buſineſs, or other, as that it is prepoſſeſt, and has no mind or leiſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the Law at the Prieſt's mouth, to hearken to his words, Charm he never ſo wiſely. And what elſe are thoſe Maſters and Parents, who either out of Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with-hold Correction, or out of cruel Harſhneſs beſtow it too liberally; who take pleaſure in Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without reſpect to Amendment; or out of ſome baſe Principle, are Partial in adminiſtring Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?</p>

                  <p>Not that all different uſage of Offenders is Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nay, rather, it would be Partiality to uſe all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, great and ſmall alike; nor is it Partiality al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to uſe unequal degrees of Correction to equal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; Reſpect ought to be had to Conſtitutions both of Body and Mind, and perhaps ſome other Circumſtances. That Doſe may poſſibly kill one, that is not enough to cure another. The Husbandmen of <hi>Judea</hi> did not threſh their Fitches with a threſhing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, nor the Cummin with a Cart-Wheel; but the Bread-Corn they bruiſed, according as their God inſtructed them to diſcretion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 26, 27, 28. But the Partiality that proceeds from Fondneſs, Fear, Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Covetouſneſs, or the like, and is not according to Juſtice, belongs to the Head of <hi>Worldly Wiſdom,</hi> and is a Symptom of a worldly mind. Ireckon that Correction is a kind of adminiſtration of Vindictive Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>What do they prefer moſt think we, that will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely correct a piece of Playfulneſs, Idleneſs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerlineſs, or it may be a piece of natural Slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Weakneſs; and in the mean time connive at a great deal of Ribaldry, Looſneſs and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, What ever Tutor, Maſter, or Parent, had rather his Pupil, Apprentice, or Child, were a good Scholar, or a good Artiſt, then a good man, that endeavors and glories in the former, more than in the latter, to him, of right, belongs the Black Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Lover of the World.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XIV.</hi> Of the Diſpoſers of Children to Callings.</head>
                  <p>WHen Children are grown up to a convenient Age, Parents or Guardians uſe to diſpoſe of them to Trades or Services, or beſtow them in Marriage.</p>
                  <p>They that diſpoſe of them to no Employment or Calling, nor engage them in no Liberal Science, or Honeſt Study, whereby they may be ſerviceable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Church or Commonwealth, becauſe they need no ſuch thing to live by, and think it is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough for them to be able to Court, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, to Entertain, to Game, like a Gentleman; are, in the judgment of Divines, ill Stewards of the Bleſſings of God, and ſad Managers of ſo great a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as Children are. And that they are ſeverely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for ſuch Careleſneſs, Cruelty, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
                  <p>But they that do not talk like Divines, do generally cry, That it is very Impolitick; for by learning No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they come to learn two of the greateſt Vices in the World, Luxury and Idleneſs; and in one of them, I had almoſt ſaid all others, For what is it not an Inlet to? Beſides, it is impolitick not to have ſome Employment, or Art, or other, to which one may have recourſe in the greateſt Extremity, which Extremity who knows but may befal him? It was well for the King of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> that he had a little more Learning than his Neighbors, that he might at leaſt turn School-Maſter, when he was Un-King'd.</p>
                  <p>The Steward in the Goſpel needed not to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken himſelf to the Knaviſh ſhift of gratifying his Lords Debtors, if he had been well educated in his
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:107613:145"/> Youth. So that to educate Children in ſome Art or Science, is Pious and Politick; but yet the Piety of it is ordinarily and eaſily ſpoiled.</p>
                  <p>For what is predominant, think we, God or the World, with thoſe Parents, who with meer reſpect to a Livelihood, or out of a more plentiful Livelihood, diſpoſe of their Children to Imployments, in their own Nature unlawful; in the management whereof their Souls ſhall as certainly die, as their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies live. Theſe do, in effect, bind them Apprentices to the Devil, and, as the Poet ſpeaks, <hi>Propter vitam vivendi perdunt cauſas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be thought there are few ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, but ſome there are ſure enough, perhaps more than will be commonly confeſt. What ſhall we think of the Trade of thoſe young Females, <hi>Alunt quae corpore corpus,</hi> as the Poet ſpeaks; and of the care of thoſe Parents, who, rather than not be Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, will mercenarily proſtitute their own Wives, which are members of themſelves; or deliver up their own Daughters, the Fruits of their own Bodies, to the Bodies of other men? I cannot excuſe, but yet, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, I cannot but pity righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> and the old hoſpitable <hi>Gibeonite,</hi> who, to reſcue their Male Gueſts, offered to expoſe their Females; Maidens that had not known Men, to the Luſts of the Sons of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For ought I know, it was in juſt judgment of God, that <hi>Lot</hi> was left to commit Inceſt with thoſe Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his, whom he was ſo forward to proſtitute to other men: But to play the Pander or the Pimp for money, is ſure filthy Lucre, if there be any in the World; and to ſell at the ſame time both Humane Souls and Bodies, muſt needs be the Merchandize of <hi>Babylon.</hi> What is predominant with thoſe Parents or
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:107613:145"/> Guardians think we, who, although they do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Children into Callings and Imployments ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unlawful, yet into thoſe that are apparently dangerous and enſnaring, and which a well confirmed Chriſtian can ſcarce manage ſafely: Or commit them to the Tuition of ignorant, carnal, prophane Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that can teach them nothing that is good, ſave their Trades; and it is ten to one, will teach them many things which are naught: Or that diſpoſe of their Children as Servants, into ſuch Families, where they ſhall never have either Precepts or Examples to lead them to Vertue, many Temptations and Inducements to Sin and Senſuality; and in the mean time Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only for the Hands, and Entertainment only for the Back and Belly.</p>
                  <p>Whether theſe People be acted by a worldly Spirit, or by the Spirit of God, is eaſie for any man, whoſe eyes are open, to diſcern. For do not they proclaim, that they prefer the Body, before the Soul; and meer Living, before Living well? Although this be not down-right deſtroying them, becauſe the grace of God may miraculouſly intervene, and preſerve the poor Children in the midſt of Fire, yet it is no Thanks to theſe mercileſs Tyrants that put them in; for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote them to deſtruction. I do not ſee but that they are as much guilty of Murder as <hi>David,</hi> and of a worſe Murder than he (whom yet the kindeſt Divine that I have met with, would never undertake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe) who, though he did not fall upon <hi>Uriah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet placed him in the Fore-front of the Battel, and then deſerted him. And therefore the Spirit of God, the beſt Caſuiſt, ſayes plainly, <hi>That he ſlew him with the Sword of the Children of</hi> Ammon. And although theſe Parents do not themſelves put out the eyes of their Children, yet if they diſpoſe of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107613:146"/> an Enemies Countrey, and let in the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> up on them to do it; if they reſign them up wholly to an ignorant, carnal, and graceleſs Society, they are as treacherous as <hi>Delilah,</hi> though ere while they were fond of them, and hugg'd them in their Boſomes, and dandled them upon their Knees.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XV.</hi> Of Perſons that Marry, and give in Marriage.</head>
                  <p>MArriage is now become neceſſary to the greateſt part of Mankind, and is made warrantable, yea, and honourable too, by the Ordination of God. I have already allow'd its juſt praiſes to a Single State, (<hi>vide Meditat.</hi> 2.) and I hope there are many that live in that State, pure and undefiled. But to oblige our ſelves, or any that are under our power, ſo to live, I doubt proves a Snare to many, and perhaps an Inconvenience to all.</p>
                  <p>But beſides thoſe that vow Virginity upon a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Account, there are a great many that prolong the Single State of their Children in deſpight of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, upon a Worldly Account, in the groſfeſt Senſe. And what can I think of thoſe Parents, who knowing the Inclinations of their Children, of a juſt Age, Conſtitution, and Diſcretion, and having fair opportunities of Matching them comfortably, do yet conſtrain them to paſs the <hi>Flower of their Youth,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſtiles it, and to ſtay for ſo many <hi>Hundreds</hi> or <hi>Thouſands,</hi> before they will part with them. I know there are a great many ſhuffling Excuſes; but to prefer Portions or Jointures, an Honourable or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful Alliance, a particular Serviceableneſs to our Selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to our Affairs, before that Peace, Purity,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107613:146"/> Satisfaction and Contentment, which is in a deſired Conjugal State, muſt needs be a Symptom of a Worldly Mind.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Parents do not behave themſelves harſhly and bitterly againſt their Children according to the Apoſtles Phraſe (<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 4.) yet I am ſure they behave themſelves unſeemly towards them, according to this Phraſe elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>It does not belong to my Meditations at this time, to ſhew the miſchievous conſequences of ſuch reſtraint, whether Whoreing and Wantonneſs, inconvenient and pernicious Matching of themſelves, uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Melancholy, Diſeaſes, and perhaps Death it ſelf. But I am heartily ſorry to find this Symptom of Worldlineſs there, where it ought leaſt of all to be found.</p>
                  <p>The lord pity all thoſe who never ſaw that they offended in this matter, till it was too late to ſee it! Of the like Character are all thoſe Parents and Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who by Threatnings or other Severities, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Importunities, and Solicitations, do force their Children, for meer Worldly Reſpects, to accept of Matches againſt their Inclination and Approbation. If there can be any Raviſhing of a Maid without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowring her, this is it; and it is the more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it is Parents Raviſhing their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And we need not wonder to ſee ſo bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſo bad premiſes, no wonder if they prove to Love where they Marry not, who were forced to Marry where they Loved not.</p>
                  <p>But of all kinds of violences, methinks Self-forcing is the moſt unnatural; and merely for the Love of Land or Money, to commit a Rape upon ones own Reaſon, Judgment, Affection, and Diſcretion, is next to Barbarous; nay, I queſtion whether there be any thing in Barbarity like it.</p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:107613:147"/>
                  <p>It was good Policy, and is brought for an Example of good Oratory, <hi>Sic Sacrilegus, ſic Fur, ſic Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiorum omnium Vitiorumque Princeps, ac est bonus Imperator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how it ſhould be good Divinity, or how it ſhould ever be the language of the heart of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, <hi>She is ignorant of the things of Religion, proud, carnal, vain, and many ways unſuitable; but yet ſhe will make me a good Wife, for ſhe has ſo much Land, or ſo much Money.</hi> That this, I ſay, ſhould be the Language of any Chriſtians heart, I ſhould be loth to believe, but how ſhall I help it: For what pretence can I have for my unbelief, when I do ſee ſo frequent Examples before my Eyes.</p>
                  <p>Does not every Body, every day, ſee Men and Women profeſſing Religion, Marrying, or Giving themſelves in Marriage, to Mates that are little elſe than Enemies to Religion, plainly preferring the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of their Eſtates, and Worldly Intereſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſpiritual Advantages, and the comfort of their Souls, or indeed Lives either? Oh but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves know no hurt by them, they have better thoughts of them; Love is blind. Would to God, Chriſtian People would deal ſincerely with themſelves, and then let any of theſe anſwer and ſay, whether they run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Marriage or blind fold or no. If not, then they have either obſerved or enquired: And if both upon obſervation and enquiry they have found nothing very deſirable, but the Eſtate or the Portion, I would fain know what is the predominant Motive. And to ſay Love is blind, is a woful ſhift; it is but a ſitting down tamely, and being content with the Character of a Fool.</p>
                  <p>It is too true, That the Love of the World does ſo blind the eyes of Men, that they can ſee none of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:107613:147"/> theſe Infirmities, Deformities, Inequalities, nor ill Conſequences neither, that do plainly enough accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or attend their Matching: but this does not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them the more excuſable, nor, methink, ſhould it give them any eaſe.</p>
                  <p>It was a little Alleviation of blind <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s miſery, grinding in the Priſon, to think that the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had put out his Eyes by Force: But for men to put out their own Eyes, and then cry, They cannot ſee; or expect to be pitied in their Drudgery, is utterly in vain. Their Bondage and Drudgery indeed renders them Pitiable, but the Blindneſ, that is alledged for the cauſe of it, renders them ridiculous. But ſhall we think then that every Man and Woman is bound to ſeek after the beſt, and accept of none but the beſt Perſons in Marriage?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not trouble my ſelf about this Captious Queſtion: But ſure I am, Goodneſs with every Lover of God ought to be a more powerful Charm, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wealth or Beauty. It is the beſt Match where they all meet, but that will not be always: However, if a man cannot have them all, he can tell which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have, and which he can be beſt content to want. This I am ſure of, if it be not a mans Duty abſolutely to ſeek the beſt Wife that he can get, it is much leſs his Duty to aim at the richeſt. I conceive the whole World of wicked Men and Women is juſtly divided into Unbelievers and Hypocrites, and I cannot but wonder that Men ſhould think themſelves bound by the expreſs Commandment not to match themſelves unequally with Unbelievers, and yet make no ſcruple at all of unequal yoking themſelves with Hypocrites; and ſuch I am confident God reckons all unregenerate Perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns to be.</p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:107613:148"/>
                  <p>I conclude this black Liſt with thoſe, who rather than not have Fortunes, will make their way to them by Felony, at one Blow breaking the <hi>Fifth, Seventh, Eighth,</hi> and <hi>Tenth</hi> Commandment. For ought I can perceive, the Marriage muſt be Lawful, before the Conjunction can be excuſed from being Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>And he that takes a Wife againſt the conſent of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Guardians, and againſt the preſcribed method of the Law, drinks ſtolen Waters, though he may ſay, (as I have heard Children) <hi>That he takes them as his own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, though Parents had no Right in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their Children to Marriage, yet there is a ſhameful Violation of Commutative Juſtice, in ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fortunes, for which there is no Satisfaction given.</p>
                  <p>And indeed they that ſteal Fortunes, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as are not able to buy them, or pay proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Jointures for them. But to what a height of Worldly Baſeneſs does this arrive, when this Adultery and Felony are exerciſed upon Children, when their Infancy and Eſtates, which ought to ſecure them, are both inſtrumental to betray them. To enſnare the Child becauſe ſhe is a Child, is like robbing the Poor becauſe he is Poor.</p>

                  <p>HOW agreeable it is in a well-conſtituted Church, that meer Lay-men ſhould have the power of preſenting Miniſters to Benefices, and what is the way in other Churches, or whether their way or ours be better, does not belong to my preſent <hi>Meditation.</hi> It ſeems likely to be attended with many Conveniencies, if the People of each particular Parochial Church ſhould freely Elect their own Paſtor: But what Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies might attend that too in time, I cannot tell, and therefore I will not determine any thing about it. I do not apprehend it to be any where contrary to the Canon of the Scripture, That Preſentations be made to Paſtoral Charges as they are here in <hi>England,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Conſtitution and Circumſtances wherein we are: But that amongſt theſe Patrons there is a great deal of Corruption, and many things that denominate them Carnal, and Lovers of the World is, too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
                  <p>Simony indeed, as our Law underſtands it, ſeems to be a Sin of Man's making, and I doubt Men deal with it accordingly; few reckoning their Conſciences to be bound by it, otherwiſe than their Oath that they take againſt it, does ſomewhat ſtraiten them; which ſtraits they think they may ſafely uſe all poſſible ſhifts to be delivered out of, never mattering to be <hi>Caſti,</hi> if they can but be <hi>Cauti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſing it to be only forbidden by a Humane Law, yet the Reaſons whereupon that Law is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeem to be ſo juſt and ſtrong, that the Law does oblige upon an higher account than its own. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:107613:149"/> preſentations will be found to be corrupt and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the ſight of God, which do not appear Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal in the eyes of Men, or the ſenſe of the Law. To be a Paſtor to a Congregation and a Steward to any part of the Houſhold of God, is certainly an Honourable Empolyment, and does require much Skill, Faithfulneſs, and Induſtry. To Feed, and Cloath, and Conduct Souls, is an Employment which the great God does not diſown, neither does he refuſe to be called their Shepherd, and the Stewards which he deputes muſt needs be ſo Able, Faithful and Painful, as to give each of his Family their Meat in due Seaſon. It muſt needs therefore be the Duty as it will be the great Honour of all Patrons as far as in them lies, to prefer Overſeers to the Flock of Chriſt, according to their worthineſs and ſitneſs. Of how great uſe to the Kingdom of Chriſt and the Salvation of Souls, the ſettling of ſuch Paſtors in Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions has been, and conſequently how great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thoſe Conſcientious Patrons are worthy of, who haue been the Inſtruments of their ſettlement, I can eaſilier contemplate with admiration, than tell to ſatisfaction. Who can with an heart unbroken, conſider the manifold fatal Conſequences of ſetting Unworthy and Unqualified Paſtors over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Chriſts Flock. The Conſequences are no leſs than the very ruin of multitudes of Souls.</p>
                  <p>And what ſhall I think then of thoſe Patrons, who never at all regard the quality of the perſon, but the quantity of the Gift? They remember ſure the ſin of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who made Prieſts of the loweſt of the people; and therefore are reſolved to run far enough from him, and make Paſtors of the richeſt of the people. But their Covetouſneſs is no leſs Carnal than his Prodigallity. They will not be ſo baſe as thoſe of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:107613:149"/> whom the Prophet complained, <hi>That they polluted the Holy Office for handfuls of Barley, and pieces of Bread;</hi> but they will not ſtick to do it for handfuls of Silver, and pieces of Money. There is no ſuch Famine in <hi>Samaria</hi> ſure, that an Aſſes Head ſhould be ſo much eſteem'd, and the Souls of Men be fed with Dung. No, No, the Famine is in the Appetites of covetous Patrons, who care not what ſilly refuſe of men they Preſent, nor how they infect or ſtarve the Souls of men, ſo they can but fill their own Pockets with the Shekels of the Sanctuary, with Gold Chymically Extracted out of theſe Leaden Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>There are a more wary Sort, that can make a ſhift to eſcape the Cenſure of the Law, who are yet acted by as ſtrong a Worldly Love as theſe: That can match a Daughter or an H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ndmaid with a Preſentation, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Clerk, as <hi>Boaz</hi> to his Kinſman, <hi>At what time thou buyest the Field, thou must buy it alſo at the hands of</hi> Ruth.</p>
                  <p>Or if ſufficient Security be given for the Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, to ſee how grateful the Clerk will prove within that time, or to ſee whether by that time a Son or Daughter may not need it for a Portion, it makes the matter a little the more ſafe, but never a whit the more honeſt. For conſidering the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this matter, whoſoever prefers Conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity or Affinity, Acquaintance, Importunity of Friends, before Learning and Piety, and Aptneſs to Teach, muſt needs appear to be acted by a World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and to bear the black Brand of our Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>Alas! How rare is this pure, ſincere, ingenuous, judicious proceeding in this matter. How few Paſtors are married to their Flocks, without the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant mediation of Friends, Monies, Importnity,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:107613:150"/> good Turns received, or expected, Relation, or ſome ſuch thing, which is Alien to the true Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Miniſter?</p>

                  <p>If <hi>Timothy,</hi> who, for ought I can perceive, was no Chaplain, was yet charg'd to charge the Great and Rich to be Humble and Religious; much more is it the Duty of theſe, who may have the care of their Prince or Patron, when the Biſhop or the Paſtor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. And to be the Inſtrument of converting one Prince and his Court, yea, or one Peer and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the ſerious and diligent Service of God, of how great Honour and Uſe would this be! Oh that all our Chaplains would propound to themſelves the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> for their pattern; and his ſucceſs in bringing <hi>David</hi> to Repentance would be for their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:107613:150"/>
                  <p>It is not fit indeed to be ſo Clowniſh, as to ſay to Princes, <hi>Ye are wicked;</hi> but yet it is fit enough to ſay, <hi>Ye are the men,</hi> with <hi>Nathan;</hi> and with <hi>Elijah, Ye are the troublers of</hi> Iſrael. And the ſame <hi>Elihu</hi> ſays, <hi>It is not fit to give flattering Titles to men.</hi> I would fain know of theſe men, if they do not charge their Patrons, and warn them, who ſhall; and where their Blood will be required, if they die in their Sins?</p>
                  <p>I hope there are many upright men in this Relation in the World, who deſign not ſo much to live upon their Patrons, as that their Patrons may live to God; to ſanctifie their Tables, rather than to be fed at them.</p>
                  <p>But if there be any that prefer Eaſe and Secular Advantage, before the Diſcharge of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that ſeek to be accepted of their Patrons, more than to approve themſelves to God, their great Maſter, the Sacredneſs of their Function will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them from being Lovers of the World.</p>

                  <p>And what of thoſe, that do plainly encourage their Patrons to Pride, Idleneſs, Exceſs, Oppreſſion, and to a Formality and Indifference in Religion; perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, that ſo much Strictneſs and Exactneſs does not become their Quality; magnifying an Half-faced Devotion for perfect; and that for a very good Deed, which they know is done by halves?</p>
                  <p>And what of thoſe, who run into the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Riot, the ſame Senſuality, it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Prophaneneſs too, for Compliance-ſake, and to humour thoſe upon whom they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance?</p>
                  <p>Such a Chaplain was the young <hi>Levite</hi> of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem Judah,</hi> who, for a Suit of Apparel, and about Twenty ſhillings a Year, and his Victuals, did not ſtick at any Idolatry that his Maſter <hi>Micah</hi> was given to, <hi>Judges</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>In any way to prefer Self-Entertainment or Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Humouring, Pleaſuring, or Gratifying of Men, before the Exerciſe of Grace, the uſing of a good Conſcience, the Reformation of Sin, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Godlineſs, and the Advancement of the Glory of God, is a Symptom of a Worldly Mind; though it be found amongſt Paſtors of Congregations, or Chaplains of Families.</p>

                  <p>THE Great Judge of the World has deputed here and there ſome amongſt men, to be his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. This certainly
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:107613:151"/> renders their Employment very Honourable, and he is a very bold and wicked man that dare contemn ſo much as the Reflections of the Authority of God, or the Majeſty of Heaven, at what Rebound ſoever. But as this Relation renders them Honourable, and a ſort of Gods, or Sons of God; ſo it does engage them to the greateſt Purity and Impartiality imaginable, leſt they bring a Reproach upon their Lord, and the ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> take occaſion to invert the Proverb, and ſay, <hi>As are the ſervants, ſuch is their Maſter.</hi> The Truth is, They that are Imitators of the Divine Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Juſtice and Goodneſs, are in a far better ſenſe the Sons of God, than they that only act in the World by his Commiſſion. For how far ſoever the inferior mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude are bound to obey them, it is evident that the God, whoſe pure Eyes cannot endure to behold Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, does not farther own them for his, than as they act by his Authority, that is agreeably to his holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and juſt Laws. I wiſh it were generally look'd upon as a Traiterous Poſition againſt the Majeſty of Heaven, that any man may act contrary to his Nature and Laws (which is a taking up Arms againſt him) by his Authority. Nay, the Commiſſion of theſe men is ſo far from Patronizing any of their Iniquity, that I doubt not but that they that pervert juſtice, and act Violence and Cruelty in his Name, ſhall be deſtroyed with a double deſtruction, and be twice condemned; once for being ungodly Sons of Men, and again, for being ungodly Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>If a Righteous King will hang a Man that commits ſimple Murder, he will not fail to hang and quarter him who commits Murders and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres, and produces his Commiſſion to juſtifie the ſame.</p>

                  <p>Now amongſt theſe Grandees of the World, it may be ſuſpected that there are many Lovers of the World more than of God.</p>
                  <p>What elſe are all they, that either injuriouſly invade the Subjects of other Princes or rigorouſly rule over their own, forgetting that themſelves have a Maſter in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>They that prefer the Gratification of their own Luſts, the Advancement of their own Names, the Inlargement of their Dominions, or Treaſures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Truth, and Charity, and the Peace and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the People committed to them, are of this Breed.</p>
                  <p>They that abuſe their Authority, either in Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing Iniquity by Laws (which is a ſetting of Gods Zeal, the Sacred Sanction of a Law, to a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own Nature and Word) or ordaining Severe and Ruining Penalties againſt light offences (which is a proſtituting the Authority of Heaven) or by making Laws on purpoſe to make men offenders, not caring whether they be broke or kept, ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may but have either the Pleaſure or Profit of exacting the Penalty; which is utterly unlike the Government of God, all whoſe reſtraints and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings do principally aim at the Good and Happineſs of his Creatures, belong to this Head.</p>
                  <p>And what elſe are all they that accept the perſons of men in Judgment, or in the Execution of Laws; that ſet Juſtice to Sale; that either defer or deſtroy the Cauſe of the Poor, becauſe he is Poor; or acquit the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe he is Rich, becauſe they fear him, or love him, or are A-Kin to him? Is not this to prefer Worldly Reſpects and Self-Intereſt, before Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and the World, before God. Let God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be heard ſpeaking to theſe men, who are ſo kind

                  <p>And what elſe are they, who in the Execution of Juſtice, are acted more by private Diſpleaſure, than Zeal for God or Righteouſneſs; who under the cloak of Law, do gratific their own Sentiment, and, like Juſtice <hi>Jehu,</hi> revenge their own Quarrel, and ſerve their own malicious Inclinations, whil'ſt they pretend to be zealous for the Law, or for the Lord.</p>

                  <p>WHen I conſider the angry and malicious Natures of Men, who are ſo apt to take Offence at every ſmall Matter, and ſo deſirous to be revenged on the Offender; and the Latitude of the Law, that makes ſo many things Actionable, (notwithſtanding the late Limitation about Petty Treſpaſſes) and the incredible multitude of men Learned in the Law, or Learners of the Law, many of which are very ready to foment Diſcontents, and promote Trivial Suits; together with the ſinful Concomitants, and fatal Effects of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law, I cannot but think the Employment of <hi>Arbitrators</hi> exceeding neceſſary, and highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; and I would commend it above all Worldly Buſineſs, (though poſſibly it may deſerve a better name) to perſons of good Educations and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, Eſtates and Leiſure; who commonly ſquander away their time to no purpoſe, or to bad ones, becauſe, forſooth, they have nothing to do.

                  <p>And becauſe it is a thing ſo excellent in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and commonly attended with ſo great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Dangers and Obloquies, it hath pleaſed the great Lover of Mankind, the Arbitrator between God and Man, to give us the greateſt Encouragement imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to it: Mat. 5. <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God:</hi> And well they may, for he is the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> and his Name is <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (alas!) with how little Purity and Integrity is this excellent Employment manag'd; what Invaſions has the Worldly Spirit made upon it, and what Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments has it mingled with it?</p>

                  <p>Are not they Lovers of the World more than of God, who ſuffer Juſtice to be perverted, and conſent to the Cruſhing and Oppreſſing of a Righteous Cauſe, meerly to gratifie the Humor or Importunity, or to conciliate or maintain the Favor and Friendſhip, of the Perſon that chuſes them?

                  <p>How many of this Breed there are I know not, I ſuppoſe few or none will confeſs it, but I doubt the God that judges impartially will find many: And the number of thoſe that live upon this Trade, and get as much by making Peace, as other men do by mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Suits, does too plainly declare before men that there are too many.</p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe, I have obſerved many, that not ſincerely regarding the merits of the Cauſe, improve all the cunning and knackiſh Skill that they have, in the Niceties of Law, to baffle or ravel, or invalidate the juſt Cauſe of their Opponent; and without any reſpect to Right or Wrong, account it their Honour to ſtand up ſtifly for the Perſon that choſe them, and to ſpeak and wrangle much in his behalf, meerly that they may get the Name of Faithful Arbitrators, and may be thought not to loſe the day, without having taken much pains to get it.

                  <p>Neither is Slaviſh Fear a leſs Worldly Principle. The poor Heathens are to be pitied, who worſhip the Devil, for fear he ſhould hurt them: But to advance men whom we ſuſpect to be of a hurtful Nature, into a Capacity of hurting us, for fear of being

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XX.</hi> Of Landlords and Tenants.</head>
                  <p>THe Holy Pſalmiſt ſomewhere ſayes (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 16.) <hi>The Heavens are the Lords, but the Earth hath he given to the Children of Men;</hi> which is not to be underſtood according to the ſenſe of the prophane Poet, <hi>Jupiter in Coelis, Caeſar regit omnia Terris,</hi> as if God had thrown the Earth out of his Hands, and would take no more care of it, or had committed it wholly to the Arbitrary Government of men: For ſtill it is true that, <hi>The Earth is the Lords;</hi> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he have granted the poſſeſſion of it to men, yet himſelf ſtill keeps the Propriety, and the Rich are his Tenants, and the Poor his Under-Tenants. Now amongſt thoſe children of men to whom God is ſaid to give the earth, ſome have ſo little a portion of it, that they may ſay with him that was rich, but for our
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:107613:155"/> ſakes became poor, That they have not where to lay their heads; or at beſt they can challenge no more of the Earth for theirs, than where they may lay their dead bodies. But yet in this unequal diſtribution there is no iniquity neither: For although God dividing the Earth amongſt Men, do not proceed by the Law of Gavel-kind; yet he has made proviſion for his poor Under Tenants, having charged his Landed Tenants, (which we more improperly call Landlords) to ſee that they be not ſtarved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ſo much as oppreſt. It is true and proper ſpeaking to ſay, that God has appointed the rich, all the rich to be Overſeers of the poor, and has declared that he accounts them his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whoſoever are not their friends.</p>
                  <p>If any of you have this worlds good, and ſee his brother have need, and ſhut up his bowels againſt him, how dwelleth the love of God in that man, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 17? God has not left it at the liberty of the rich, whether they will adminiſter to the poor or no, but has as much oblig'd them to charity towards them as to Juſtice towards one another: And it is not to be doubted but that the poor have as good a right to ſome part of our Eſtates, as we have to the reſt. And for ought I know this may be one Principal reaſon of that ſaying of our Saviours (call it Propheſy or Promiſe) <hi>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">
                           <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>

If it be ſo, that the firſt Worldly Bleſſing is to be Rich, I think the next is that there are Poor about us.</p>
                  <p>The nobleſt uſe that can be made of riches is to give them away (according to that Golden Sentence that it ſeems our Savior was often wont to uſe, <hi>Beatius
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:107613:155"/> est dare quam accipere;</hi>) And I am ſure the propereſt Object of Giving, are thoſe that have Little or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their Own.</p>
                  <p>But who can perſuade the <hi>Mammoniſts</hi> of this world, that this is good Divinity? Alas, how few live and act as if they believed it! Oh wretched and barbarous Guardians, that in ſtead of putting on Cloaths upon the Naked Skin, pull off the Skin from the Fleſh; that live in all manner of Pleaſure and Wantonneſs, ſpending profuſely upon their Luſts of Playfulneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance or Uncleanneſs; and in the mean time Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the Money of their poor Tenants, whereby theſe Proviſions may be made for the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>How dwells the Love of God in that Man, whoſe Hounds and Horſes, and it may be Whores too, are Fat and Fair-liking, and in the mean time his poor induſtrious Tenants, and their Children, ſo nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to their Landlord, are almoſt ready to periſh for want of Bread. The Poor in general, as Men, are nearlier related to us by the Law of Nature, than Dogs and Horſes; as Chriſtians, they are ſtill nearer A-kin to us; and as Tenants, ſeem to be related to their Landlords in a Political Capacity, and to be, as it were, of their Family. For who can think otherwiſe, but that God in diſtributing the Kingdoms and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of the Earth, intended that Kings ſhould take all their Subjects to be their Children, as to Paternal Care, and Landlords ſhould eſteem their Tenants as their <hi>Ward,</hi> and conſtituent Members of their Family. In the diſtribution of the Holy Land, God gave no lot to <hi>Levi,</hi> whom yet he loved as well as any of the reſt, intending that the <hi>Levites</hi> ſhould be maintained at the Charge of the reſpective Tribes amongſt whom they reſided. It is partly thus in the diſtribution of the World; where God could eaſily have made proviſion
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:107613:156"/> of Land for every man, and have made all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth Freeholders; but he has past by one Tribe, even all the Poor of the Earth, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as it ſeems, to employ the Care and Charity, and Pity of their Brethren about them. It is a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Maxim in Law, <hi>Cujus est lucrum, ejus est dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> That he that receives the Gains, ſhould bear the loſs, according to the Cuſtom of the Holy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that he that bought the Land, ſhould alſo charge himſelf with the Widow, and content to have <hi>Ruth</hi> for his Wife: ſo ſhould every man who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herits or purchaſes a Lordſhip, conſider with what ſtock of poor Tenants it is charged, and take care that by ſome honeſt means or other they be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>But how dwells the Love of God in thoſe Landlords, who never conſidering the Charge that God has laid upon them, nor the Relation wherein their Tenants ſtand to them, exact the utmoſt worth of the Land, by their good wills allowing nothing for the labor and pains of the Tenants, nor for their Hazards nor Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes neither. It is a Prerogative competible to God alone, to do what he will with his own: For all men are Stewards, and ought to eye the Will of God more than their own. It is true indeed, every Landlord may, yea, and ought to make the beſt of his own: But then if it muſt be conſidered in what ſenſe his Lands are his own, (ſure I am they are ſo his own, that he muſt give an account of the management of them to a higher Landlord;) And it muſt be conſidered what it is to <hi>make the best</hi> of ones own. He makes the beſt of his Eſtate; Not who improves it, and racks it to the utmoſt Penny; Not who ſtudiouſly adds Land to Land, and Lordſhip to Lordſhip; Not he who lays up Goods and Monies for many Years: But he who puts
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:107613:156"/> his Eſtate to the beſt Uſe, and improves it to the beſt Ends; that does moſt glorifie God with his ſubſtance: who loves to give, rather than to receive. Go now Gentlemen, and in God's Name make the beſt of your own.</p>
                  <p>And how dwells the Love of God in thoſe Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, who purchaſing or inheriting open Lordſhips, (where from Generation to Generation many poor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, partly by their Labour, and partly by their Right to Commons, have lived comfortably) do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe them to their own proper uſe, without any juſt reſpect to the meaner ſort, that have ſome ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt there, or any charitable reſpect to the pooreſt of all; and ſo drive thoſe away from them, whom Chriſt has foretold they ſhould always have with them. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks ſomewhat Rhetorical of the Firſt-born of the Poor, whom he would have diſdain'd to have ſet with the Dogs of his Flock; this is, he would not have them his Shepherds. But theſe men, by a barbarous <hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> turn the Poor of the Land into Dogs of the Flock, a Shepherd and his Dog ſupplying the place and employment of many Families. It was a grievous Complaint when they cry'd,</p>
                  <q>—<hi>Jam Seges est ubi</hi> Troja <hi>fuit.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Complaint is as juſt, though the Poetry be not ſo good,</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>And how dwells the Love of God in thoſe Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, who, when by their ſevere Uſage they have made their induſtrious Tenants poor, or when ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary hand of God hath touch'd them, and made

                  <p>SOme are of Opinion concerning Trades, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning the Law, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 8. That they are all good, if a man uſe them lawfully:</hi> Which, for ought I know, (if it be meant of the Trades that are allowed by Law, concerning which the Law has made Rules, and to which the Law has annext Priviledges) is very true: But yet theſe two things muſt be confeſt, <hi>That all Trades are not alike ſelf and laudable; nor may every Age and Temper be committed to any Trade indifferently.</hi>
                  </p>

So do all they that make the getting of Wealth, and the raiſing of themſelves, or their Friends or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to a ſingular and unwieldly Greatneſs, the main and higheſt end of all their Occupations; little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſpecting Charity to the Poor, or the Good of the Publick.</p>
                  <p>And ſo do they, who by making falſe or unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wares, put a Cheat upon Mankind, and elude
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:107613:158"/> the Neceſſities of the World, inſtead of relieving them. What can be more directly a preferring of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain, before the Publick Good?</p>

                  <p>AT the firſt naming of this ſort of People, it will be expected by ſome, That I ſhould give them all a Paſs, and pack them away to their own place. But I am not certain that one and the ſame place is aſſign'd to them all, and therefore it is beſt to conſider awhile of them.</p>
                  <p>I think there is a Text ſomewhere ſpeaking to this purpoſe, as if it forbad any Beggar to be in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And I do well remember there is another, That fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels that the Poor ſhall never ceaſe out of the Land. I think they may well be reconciled: There ſhall always be perſons ſo Poor as to need to be provided for, and yet there ought to be ſuch proviſion made for them that they ſhall not beg; ſo that it is rather the Sin of the Rich, than of the Poor, that there are any Beggars. There ſeems to be an expreſs Law to preſerve People from Begging: But I know no Law or Reaſon, that forbids People to Beg, that cannot otherwiſe live.</p>
                  <p>I know no promiſe that ſecures a Righteous man from being reduced to a ſtate of Beggary, nor indeed no ſubſtantial Reaſon that will defend him; he may as well Beg, as be Baniſh'd Diſeaſed, Martyred. But what ſhall we ſay to the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> who tells us, <hi>He never ſaw the Seed of the Righteous begging their Bread,</hi> Pſal. 37. 25.</p>
                  <p>I remember I once urg'd this Text to a Beggar-Woman at my own Door, finding her to diſcourſe Underſtandingly and Chriſtianly, and to pretend to Religion; who premiſing a little Sigh, anſwer'd me very readily, <hi>True, Sir,</hi> the Pſalmiſt <hi>does ſay ſo;

                  </p>
                  <p>This Anſwer I laid to heart, and it made me kind to her at that time, and to think more Oharitably of that whole Tribe of Mankind ever ſince. For it is not only true, That <hi>David</hi> begg'd his Bread at that time, but it ſeems (as far as I can compute) that ſome Years of his Life were led in a Genteeler kind of Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary. And I find thoſe Divines that urge the promiſes of the Law to preſerve the Righteous from Beggary, and will have <hi>David</hi>'s experience in this <hi>Pſalm</hi> to be accommodated to all Ages, are yet fain to come off and tell us, <hi>That all theſe Temporal Promiſes are to be underſtood,</hi> Cum Exceptione Caſtigationis &amp; Crucis, <hi>ſaving to God the Prerogative of Correcting and Chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his People, how and when he pleaſes.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>David</hi> ſaw in his days, the Apoſtle tells us of many in other days, <hi>whom the World was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> that were yet Treated, as if they were not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to live in the World: And we ſee them in our days reduc'd to a neceſſity of living upon their Neighbors, and asking Relief too. That theſe are Poor, may not be their own fault, but their Maker's pleaſure: That they ask Relief, is the fault of others, that will not relieve them without asking. And as for the Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Begging, which ſeems to be moſt ſhameful, and of worſt Report, I do not ſee, but that it is poſſible for a Good Man to be reduc'd to this alſo. The Blind and the Lame that begg'd by the way-ſide, and at the Gate of the Temple, had ſome of them ſo much Faith as to be healed: And if we could take a view of the Inhabitants of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:107613:161"/> as could be imagined, tranſlated thither from the Rich mans Gates. How would ſuch a ſight make us wonder and ſay, with them in the Text, <hi>Is not this he that ſate by the way-ſide, and lay at the Gates begging?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wiſeſt of men tell us, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 11. That wiſe men ſometimes want bread, and men of underſtanding are ſometimes poor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is accounted a ſhame for men to Beg, but I think it is a greater ſhame to ſuffer them; and this ſhame lights either upon the Rich that do not relieve them, or the Magiſtrates that do not reſtrain them, if they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd. The Law of <hi>England</hi> has provided for all ſorts of Poor; either to employ the Able, or to relieve the Impotent: And yet, to the ſhame of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of the Laws, we ſee that the Hedges and High-wayes are not compelled to keep in.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly a great Reproach to the Chriſtian World, and eſpecially to our Nation, that there are any itinerant and errant Beggars found amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>All which will not excuſe the Able that can work, nor the Impotent that are by Law provided for in any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner, from being A-kin to him whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter it is, that he compaſfes the World about, and like an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXIV.</hi> Of Wagerers.</head>
                  <p>IN this Licentious Age, wherein men generally act Hand-over-head, and live <hi>Ex-tempore,</hi> not troubling their Conſciences with any Caſes, nor reducing their Actions to any Conſideration, the practice of laying Wagers is grown very familiar to almoſt all ſorts of men. I will not abſolutely, without Exception, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn every Wager whatſoever. For ſome are ſo ſmall, and the Winning or Loſing them is of ſo little regard, the perſons that Lay them are ſo unconcern'd, and free from Fear or Covetouſneſs, and the end of them ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, as to determine ſome little doubtful Truth, or to give a little life and vigor to ſome honeſt, harmleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement, and perhaps it is ſo ſeldom too, that there ſeems to be no danger ariſing therefrom.</p>
                  <p>But without Controverſie, the common and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary practice of Wagering is very unjuſtifiable, and ought, with the reſt of the Symptoms of a Worldly Mind, to be exploded.</p>
                  <p>Such a Symptom I take all Wagering to be, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a covetous deſire of getting that which is another mans, or is accompany'd with a vexatious Fear of loſing our own. For Covetouſneſs and diſtracting Carefulneſs are ever bad, and that cannot be very good, that is the proper, direct, efficient cauſe of them. If it be ſaid, <hi>That in ſo ſaying, I condemn all Wagers without Exception, even the ſmalleſt, as being all attended with ſome degree or other of Covetouſneſs.</hi> I think it is very falſely objected; for I know ſome men, now and then, lay ſome ſmall Wager, which they are very indifferent whether they Win or Loſe, nay, which they had rather Loſe than Win,</p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:107613:162"/>
                  <p>Such a Symptom are all ſuch Wagers that are laid for the abetting and encouraging of ſcandalous or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious Actions or Sports. For if it be unſeemly, and of ill report to men to run Races ſtark naked, or Women next to naked; to abett the ſame by Wagers, cannot be ſafe or ſeemly.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch a Symptom are all ſuch Wagers as impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh or weaken him that lays them it he Loſe, or his Adverſary if he Win. It is a very uncomfortable way of coming to Poverty, by loſing great Wagers; and indeed it is a ſorry, paltry way of getting Riches, to get them by Winning. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſcorn'd a far Genteeler way of enriching himſelf than this, by the Spoil of his conquer'd Enemies, that it might not be ſaid, that the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> had made <hi>Abraham</hi> rich.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch a Symptom are all ſuch bold Wagers that are laid concerning Events that are purely in the hand of God, no room being left for ſecond Cauſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, and make a humane Probability or Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilty. This looks like a prophane piece of Sawci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For how can mortal man intermeddle with the Counſels of the great God, to ſtint, limit, engage or excuſe them, and be innocent? But I have known Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers alſo laid meerly in ſtead of Arguments, when men have had nothing to ſay in defence of their Cauſe; and others laid concerning things, which can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or determined. And oftentimes they that are ſo forward to lay Wagers, will not venture to pitch upon a certain Judge who may determine whether they Win or Loſe. Theſe alſo are Symptoms like the former, only ſomewhat worſe: For beſides the Impiety and Impertinency, they argue a great degree of ſhameful Folly.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXV.</hi> Of Gameſters.</head>
                  <p>I Think it is generally concluded, That Exerciſe is expedient, and upon the matter neceſſary, for the health of the Body. Phyſicians contend for the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of ſome Recreations in particular to ſome Conſtitutions, and ſo they alot Ringing to ſome, Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, Hunting to others, and Bowling to others. I had rather believe theſe Artiſts, than diſpute with them; though it ſeems that the end of all theſe Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations may be attained as well by Riding or Walking. I ſhall eſteem him a wiſe and temperate man, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theſe Recreations by no other conſideration, but that of Health: But I fear there are few ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Recreations are alſo ſaid to be needful to the relief of the mind, which I will not deny: And yet ſo far as I can apprehend, the Variety of Buſineſs is the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, and does as effectually relieve the mind, as any Sports whatſoever: For my own part, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire no better Recreation of mind, than to go from one Buſineſs to another, that ſhould be within my call and compaſs; and then ſeaſonably to lay down both the one and the other upon my Pillow. But whatſoever may be ſaid in Vindication of ſome Sports, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly many others which cannot be juſtify'd; yea, and the Gameſters will be found <hi>Lovers of the World, and not of the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such Gameſters are they, who follow Sports in their own Nature unlawful, being againſt the Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Temperance, or Modeſty.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch are they, who follow Sports in themſelves lawful, unlawfully; that is, unrighteouſly, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, or unſeaſonably. I reckon that they follow Sports
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:107613:163"/> unrighteouſly, who make a Calling of Gaming, and Recreation their Buſineſs, thereby either endeavouring to get other mens Eſtates, or venturing to loſe their own. The nature of Commutative Juſtice requires, that when I receive that which is another mans, I part with ſomething of my own that is equivalent, and bears ſome due proportion to it. Hereby the gains of Wagers and Gaming comes to be rank'd amongſt other filthy Lucre, and may be matcht with the price of a Dog, or the hire of an Harlot.</p>
                  <p>And here, by the way, I cannot but ſtop a little, and complain of the Careleſneſs and Cruelty of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Maſters, who inſtruct, or encourage, or ſo much as allow their Children, Servants or Scholars, to play for money. Is not Covetouſneſs a ſufficient blemiſh to our old Age, but we muſt be inur'd to it in our Youth? Is it not Cruelty, to inſtruct Children to cheat and wrong one another, before they be in a capacity to make Reſtitution? Is the Love of money the Root of all Evil; and yet we take ſo much care to plant it, and that in the minds of thoſe whom we pretend to preſerve from Evil? It cannot eaſily be computed, how much idle, covetous, contentious, cozening Converſation is uſher'd into the World by this kind of Education; nor how many miſchievous Conſequences there are of it. <hi>Oh that all that pretend to love the Father, would dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently watch against the introduction of the love of the world into the hearts of their Children by this means!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides thoſe Gameſters that unrighteouſly get or ſpend Eſtates by Gaming, there are others, <hi>Lovers of Pleaſures, more than Lovers of God;</hi> who ſpend their time exceſſively in Sports, pleaſurably paſſing away their Time, which without Paſtimes, haſtens away apace; and which when it is paſt, cannot be call'd back, though one would give all the ſubſtance of his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:107613:164"/> Houſe to retrieve it. I know it is unjuſt to determine the ſame meaſure of time for Sports to all men; and I think it is unſafe to determine an exact meaſure to any man. But every mans own Conſcience, if he examine it, can tell him, Whether he be a Lover of Pleaſure, more than of God; whether he live in Pleaſure; whether he ſpend his time, either more largely, or more gladly, in Sports or in Devotion, or good Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or which he prefers or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

One would think it that a Chriſtian Preacher ſhould make

It is certainly a weak Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that becauſe Men have good Eſtates, and need not Work nor Trade to maintain themſelves, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God does require no buſineſs at all of them, but that their time is their own: And as for thoſe that are in a Clerical Capacity, methinks the Children of this World (who act at a more induſtrious rate) ſhould ſhame the Children of Light, or the Lights of the World, (let them call themſelves by what name they pleaſe) out of that ſilly fancy, that becauſe they have got a little Learning, therefore they need ſtudy no more; or becauſe they can make a Sermon in one day of a Week, and preach it on another, that therefore the other five are their own to play with.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the Worldly Gameſters, the unſeaſonable make up as great a number, as the unrightcous or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate. I reckon thoſe unſeaſonable Gameſters, who purloin from the Lords-day, to beſtow in Sports and Recreations. I will not enter into the Controverſie about the Morality of the Sabbaths, nor the certain Right of Succeſſion that the Lords day hath to the Holy Reſt of the Seventh day; but I do believe that the Conſcience of a good man is the beſt Caſuiſt in this matter: And that every ſuch man in the World doth think it reaſonable to appropriate ſome certain time to the more immediate and ſolemn Worſhip of God; and that no ſuch man will grudge a ſeventh part of his time to ſo good a matter, who gives him all the reſt; and that there are many ſuch men, who are ſo far from grudging God one day in a Week, that they had rather every day in the Week, and every Week in the Year, and every Year of their Lives, could be directly ſpent in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of that God to whom they owe all they have, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:107613:165"/> in communion with whom (and therein I place the true Celebration of a Sabbath) their true and proper happineſs doth conſiſt. And I am of opinion with Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> and many other good men, <hi>That Religion doth proſper or decay in Church, Family, or ſingle Soul, proportionably as the Chriſtian Sabbath is obſerved or neglected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems that there are ſome Pleaſures allow'd us in general, which are therefore call'd <hi>our own,</hi> Iſa. 58. 13. which yet we are required to refrain from on God's Holy-day. And I ſee no reaſon he has to complain for want of Recreation on the Sabbath, to whom the Sabbath it ſelf is the greateſt Recreation: which I pray God it may be to all that pretend to a predominant love of the Father.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe Conſcientious Senſualiſts, who uſe Sports on the Lords-day, to prove that they are no <hi>Jews;</hi> the end may be good poſſibly, but the method that they take, will, I doubt, indifferently ſerve to prove, that they are no good Chriſtians neither.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, there are other Worldly Gameſters who indulge themſelves in Sports and Pleaſures, in a time of Publick Calamity or Danger; whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> deſcribes, (<hi>Amos</hi> 16. in the beginning) and God threatens above all ſorts of men that I read of, except thoſe that blaſpheme the Holy Ghoſt, ſaying, <hi>That their iniquity ſhall not be purged from them till they dye,</hi> Iſa. 22. 14. In ſhort, It is the Character of true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they cannot make merry when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> is oppreſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. and by the Rule of Contraries, it is a Symptom of a Senſualiſt to nouriſh himſelf in a day of ſlaughter.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXVI.</hi> Of Debters.</head>
                  <p>SIN is properly a Debt; but to be in Debt, is not properly a Sin: If it were, what Conſolation could be adminiſtred to them that were born in Debt, and continue therein ſore againſt their Wills; to them that are engaged therein meerly by the Providence of God, or reduc'd thereunto by the Injuſtice or Oppreſſion of men. But yet to be much in Debt, and that inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, is a very great Calamity, and eſpecially burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to a juſt and ingenious mind; and yet more eſpecially, if contracted by any fault or folly of his own. For if to loſe Eſtates, and lay down Life it ſelf upon a Publick or Charitable Account, be accounted Generous and Virtuous; to run into Debt upon ſuch Account, ought not ſure to be eſteemed ſcandalous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> ſomewhere tells us, <hi>That the Borrower is Servant to the Lender.</hi> And indeed if there were no more in it, but this loſs of Liberty, it would make that condition troubleſome and uneaſie: But alas it is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many other miſchiefs and dangers, which do ſtill inhance the Calamity. The Precept therefore, <hi>of owing no man any thing,</hi> Rom. 13. 8. is given us in much mercy, and God does therein conſult our eaſe, ſafety and quiet; as by commanding us to be chaſte and temperate, and righteous, he does conſult our health and credit. There are two Commands in the Text, <hi>To owe no man any thing, and to love all men always.</hi> The former ſeems a very hard Commandment to the Poor, and it is almoſt impoſſible for them to perform it: (<hi>Juvet idem qui jubet!</hi>) The latter is ſeldom (I doubt) performed by the Rich; whoſe Riches, for the moſt part, make them proud, diſdainful, oppreſſive and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:107613:166"/> covetous. The performance of the former ſeems to depend upon the performance of the latter: For how is it poſſible that the Poor ſhould be out of Debt, if the Rich be not kind and charitable? But if all men did love their Neighbors as themſelves, then it were eaſie to conceive that no man need ow any thing to any. What then, Does God command men Impoſſibilities? Does he with-hold Straw, and yet command his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to make Brick? Does he ſend men naked into the world, and leave them deſtitute of all things, even of ſtrength it ſelf, and yet charge them neither to beg nor borrow, but to ſtarve? No, this cannot be; we muſt therefore relax the ſeeming ſeverity of this Command, by ſome favourable interpretation, and ſay, <hi>We muſt not wilfully and needleſly contract Debts, nor careleſly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly continue in them.</hi> It is neither true nor charitable arguing, to conclude, That any Man is unjuſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is inſufficient; no more than it was in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Tyrant, who concluded the poor People were idle, becauſe they did not give in the wonted Tale of Bricks, when the Straw was deny'd them. As there may be great Charity, where there is but a Mite, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly nothing at all given; ſo there may be true Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, where nothing is paid. And it becomes us to imitate the gracious Nature of God, who accepteth men for Charitable, <hi>In whom he findeth a willing mind, according to what they have, and not according to what they have not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12. And for Righteous, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they can do, and not according to what they cannot.</hi> The conſideration of the great Debt, which we all, even the moſt ſolvent of the Sons of Men, owe to the Almighty God, ſhould make us favourable both in puniſhing and cenſuring thoſe that are indebted to us; and our Short-ſightedneſs and Fallibility ſhould make us take heed we do not prove our ſelves unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:107613:166"/> whil'ſt we ſo liberally condemn other People for unrighteous.</p>
                  <p>But yet there is a contracting of, and continuing in Debt, which is very unrighteous, and a Symptom of a Worldly Mind. Such is that, when men by Riotous, Idle, or Extravagant Living, ſpend their own Eſtates, and reduce themſelves to a neceſſity of being beholden to other mens. If it be Unskilfulneſs, Unadviſedneſs, Weakneſs or Overſight, it is uneaſie to be born, and ſomewhat ſhameful to be imputed: But I dare not ſay it is wicked, becauſe I do not know that any man is bound in Conſcience to be unſurprizably and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>featably cunning in the management of any Secular Affairs, no, though his Education have been in it.</p>
                  <p>Such is that, when men ſee the Languiſhings of their Trades or Eſtates, and that they are no longer able to bear the weight of their Expences, and yet will rather chuſe to ſupply thoſe Expences out of other mens Eſtates, than they will retrench them. Nay, for ought I know, Charity it ſelf (commonly ſo call'd) may be to blame here; for paying to another man what is his, ought to take place of giving away ones one.</p>
                  <p>Such is that much more, when men make other mens Eſtates maintain their Luſts, their unneceſſary Pomp and Grandeur of Living, their unwieldly Purchaſes or Portions, or any thing ſuperfluous.</p>
                  <p>Such is that, when men either unneceſſarily delay to pay their Debts, if they be demanded; or do not make ſatisfaction to their Ability for any Loſs really ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it be required by the Creditor, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Juel,</hi> is the onely allowable <hi>Interest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is that, when men caſt about, and ſeek ways to defeat the Creditor; or will ſo much as make uſe of any Trick or Nicety in Law, to avoid the payment of a juſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:107613:167"/> and honeſt Debt. Nay, ſuch is that, when men could wiſh with themſelves, that they could by any plauſible means defeat him. Nay if they do not with as much chearfulneſs, if their Circumſtances do capacitate them, pay what they have borrow'd, as they borrow'd what they needed, they cannot eſcape the blemiſh of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Injuſtice, or a predominant Love of the World.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXVII.</hi> Of Creditors.</head>
                  <p>I That hpleaſed the wiſe Governor of the World ſo to order it, that no one man in the World ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with all things; but that all men ſhould, in ſome thing or other, ſome time or other, ſtand in need of the aſſiſtance of their Neighbors. The greateſt Kings are ſometimes forced to borrow Anxiliaries, and the wiſeſt to ask Counſel of their Friends. God will not have the Head to ſay, ſo much as to the Feet, <hi>I have no need of you.</hi> Whether it be by a ſenſe of their own inſufficiency, to maintain Humility in every man, or by a ſenſe of the Neceſſities of Mankind, to exerciſe Charity and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence in all men, I know not; but ſo it is, that all the Members of the Creation, as well as of the Body, mutually need the help of one another. And I doubt not but that it is a Moral Duty for all men to be ready to lend their aſſiſtance, to ſerve a good End, as far as their Capacity will permit. For ſo commanded Love it ſelf; <hi>From him that will borrow of thee, turn thou not away.</hi> There are many People of this middle-ſize in the World, who are not ſo Rich as to give away; but yet they are well able to Lend, at leaſt ſmall Sums, for a ſmall time. This to do, I reckon, is a great piece of Charity, and the moſt conſiderable method, that a mean and inconſiderable man can uſe. It is almoſt like the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:107613:167"/> miraculous feeding of Thouſands with a few Loaves, which was our Saviour's Charity, where the ſtock was laid out, and yet was not loſt, nor ſo much as diminiſht-Money can do that without a Miracle ſucceſſively, which theſe Loaves of his by a Miracle perform'd at once. Now I believe if men were perſuaded that they ſhould take up ſo many Baskets full, and that their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould be multiply'd as his Bread was, they would try to work Wonders with their money too. And I pray, who knows but that the merciful God, who loves mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may, by a ſpecial Bleſſing of his own, increaſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſo laid out, and will requite thoſe that lend to him; <hi>For there is that ſcattereth, and yet increaſeth.</hi> I do not think it was one of the ſame Fiſhes where with he fed the Multitude, that afterwards return'd to give him Thanks, or make Requital; but we know that he who only gave Fiſh with a little Bread to it, received Fiſh again with money in the mouth of it. But ſuppoſe it ſhould not pleaſe God to make any ſuch advantageous Reſtitution, the Lender has no cauſe to complain; for beſides his Principal, he has this intereſt of having done Good, and relieved the neceſſity of his poor Brethren. If I lend an Hundred pound, and at the Years end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive back my Principal, and get ſome Six pound debt of my own diſcharg'd into the Bargain, Do not I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly receive <hi>Six per Cent.</hi> for my money? When I lend to the Poor, I pay part of a Debt to them, and there's my intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Well, Lending is a great piece of Charity, plainly commanded, and highly commended in the Holy Book: And I doubt not, but that there are many in the World now living, who, if they were call'd, would come out and ſay, <hi>It has been their greateſt Relief, and that they had Begg'd, if it had not been for Borrowing.</hi> In ſome reſpect it is an higher Act of Charity, than Giving.</p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:107613:168"/>
                  <p>But yet there are a ſort of Creditors, who even in Lending, do declare themſelves to be <hi>Lovers of the World, and not of the Father.</hi> So do they that Lend out of Pride and Vain-glory, rather to oſtentate their own Fulneſs, than relieve their Brothers Wants; as the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch feaſted his Subjects, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1. 4. not out of Charity to them, but <hi>to ſhew the Riches of his Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So do they that Lend out of malice, to have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to reproach the Debtor, or inſult over him: like the counſel that <hi>Shemaiah</hi> ſeem'd charitably to give <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to ſecure himſelf in the Temple; the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ign of which was not indeed the good and ſafety of that Prince, but that the Enemy might bring up an evil Report againſt him, and reproach him. Or if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wards they make it a matter of Reproach, it comes all to one. Or if they make it a common pleaſant Table-talk to others, it ſwerves wonderfully from the Command of our Holy Law-giver, who charges us to be reſerv'd in all our Acts of Charity, that the Left Hand, as near as it is, ſhould not know what the Right Hand doth.</p>
                  <p>So do they, that Lend out of Carnal Cunning; the more eaſily to wind themſelves into the Eſtates of other men, and to get a Footing there, from whence they are reſolved, if poſſible, never to be removed. This is like the wicked kindneſs of <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> giving him his Daughter to Wife, only that ſhe might be a ſnare to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 21. and that he might be Decoy'd to his Ruine. Whether the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> allude to this kind of Policy amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> or no, I know not; but this Phraſe fits it very well, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 11. <hi>Let the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner catch all that he hath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo do they that Lend out of Covetouſneſs, not out of any Charitable Deſign to relieve others, but out
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:107613:168"/> of a Covetous Deſign to enrich themſelves: They do indeed accidentally feed others, but the main intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to multiply their own Loaves. Whoſoever predominantly ſeeks himſelf, or his own private Gain, in Giving or Lending, depraves the Sacred Nature of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; whoſe lovely Character it is, <hi>That ſhe ſeeketh not her own:</hi> Yea, ſo tender is the delicate conſtitution of this Grace, that it is violated by an evil Eye, by Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerings, and Expectations, and Reſpect to Reward, where no Bonds nor Covenant do intervene. Read the Story of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and you would think he was a man very free from Covetouſneſs, who would not go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſs Leave; and when he was come to <hi>Balak,</hi> would not take any Bribe or Reward of him at all: And yet where man can ſee nothing, God can eſpie Faults; for under all this ſeeming Contempt of the World, the Searcher of Hearts charges him, <hi>That his way was perverſe before him.</hi> And again, in <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>He ran greedily for Reward.</hi> And this now brings me to conſider of that Notorious Sort of Lenders, call'd <hi>Uſurers;</hi> concerning whom I muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily enlarge my <hi>Meditation.</hi>

                  <p>I Have often ſaid, when I have been conſulted, That I was not ſo well ſatisfied in the Lawfulneſs of <hi>Uſury,</hi> as to practiſe it; nor yet durſt I abſolutely condemn it without any Limitation, in all thoſe who at any time venture upon it. It has of late Years (for I never heard any man plead for it out of Antiquity) crept into the Converſation and Judgment too (And I fear out of the former into the latter; for men uſually ſet themſelves to juſtifie what they do, and love to do) of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:107613:169"/> ſo many Reverend Divines and Profeſſors of Religion, otherwiſe not ſcandalous, that meer Modeſty, I think, keeps many men from meddling againſt <hi>it,</hi> leſt they ſhould appear to meddle againſt <hi>them,</hi> and condemn a juſt Generation. But yet it lies ſo fully in my way, and there being a neceſſity that I muſt either ſtep over it, or remove it, I will prefer the intereſt of Truth, before the Authority and Friendſhip of men; leſt whil'ſt I condemn <hi>the predominant Lovers of the World,</hi> I my ſelf ſhould betray my ſelf to be one. Not that it lies upon my hands to ſtate and determine the Controverſie about <hi>Uſury,</hi> but to ſhew what <hi>Uſurers are Lovers of the World, more than of the Father.</hi> If all ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be found ſuch, it is their Fault, and not mine; and, poſſibly, by the bleſſing of God, the Diſcovery may tend to the Cure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Controverſie about Uſury,</hi> did I call it? And, indeed, I cannot but wonder what has made it a Controverſie. I doubt we muſt give the ſame account of the <hi>Origen</hi> of this Controverſie, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> does of Wars Wars and Fightings in general, <hi>That it comes from the Luſts of Men.</hi> The Want of Conſcience, makes the Caſe of Conſcience: For God and his whole Church ſeem to have ſtated this matter as fully and plainly as any other thing whatſoever, and I cannot find that till within theſe Hundred Years, or thereabouts, any Body appear'd openly in defence of it, or durſt go about to oppoſe the Authority of God and Men, of Scriptures, Councels and Fathers in this matter. So that although <hi>Uſury</hi> be a very idle Sin, yet the <hi>Defence</hi> of it ſeems to be a very new one. <hi>Uſury</hi> is chiefly condemn'd by Authorities, and chiefly defended by Arguments. I will chiefly inſiſt therefore upon thoſe two Heads, and then in the laſt place, which is properly my buſineſs, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>Worldly Uſurer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:107613:169"/>
                  <p>I know there are many Arguments brought by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, Politicians and Divines againſt <hi>Uſury.</hi> But I do not ſee that there is any need of the weak Props of Humane Reaſon to ſupport Divine Authority. When God ſpeaks, he ſpeaks Reaſon, whether we comprehend it or no. To his Authority therefore I betake my ſelf, as reckoning that I need no more, though much more might be had. The Command in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 25. and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 37. is very plain and peremptory; <hi>If thou lend money to any of my People that is poor by thee, thou ſhalt not be to him as an Uſurer, neither ſhalt thou lay upon him Uſury. If thy Brother be waxen poor, thou ſhalt relieve him: Take no Uſury of him or Increaſe, but fear thy God, that thy Brother may live with thee; thou ſhalt not give him thy Money upon Uſury, nor lend him thy Victuals for Increaſe.</hi> Afterwards when the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver comes to repeat this Law, he explains it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces it, <hi>Deut. 23. 19, 20. Thou ſhalt not lend upon Uſury to thy Brother, Uſury of Money, Uſury of Victuals, Uſury of any thing that is lent upon Uſury; unto a Stranger thou may'st lend upon Uſury, but unto thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt not lend upon Uſury.</hi> This repetition of the Law differs ſomething from the former, but whether it be in favor of <hi>Uſury</hi> or no, I ſhall ſee, when I come to conſider the Arguments brought in defence of <hi>Uſury.</hi> Now let any man caſt his eye upon <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. and conſider in what a ſtudious and fervent manner, that pious and charitable Governor goes about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Oppreſſion, that was crept in amongſt the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Nobles and Rulers of his time. He was very angry when he heard the complaint of the Poor againſt theſe <hi>Uſurers,</hi> he enters into ſerious conſideration with himſelf, and calls a counſel in his own generous breaſt, how he may redreſs this Grievance. He rebuked them; that, I ſuppoſe, might be privately: but when that did
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:107613:170"/> not avail, his zeal did ſo tranſport him, that one would almoſt ſuſpect it was beyond diſcretion; he ſtirs up the multitude againſt them; he argues the Caſe with them; he preſſes it upon their Conſciences from two or three weighty Conſiderations; and at laſt condeſcends to Intreaty, <hi>I pray you let us leave off this Uſury.</hi> And yet all the <hi>Uſury of Money</hi> that they were guilty of, was but the hundreth part, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. How zealous may we ſuppoſe this good Governor would have been againſt the twentieth part, which is eſteemed kind uſage in theſe days. When <hi>David</hi> deſcribes the man whom God will accept, he requires that he be a man <hi>that puts not out his Money to Uſury,</hi> Pſal. 15. 5. And when the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribes a man whom God will for ever reject, he deſcribes him <hi>by giving forth upon Uſury, and taking Increaſe,</hi> Ezek. 18. 13. And again, deſcribing a People whom God will judge, he deſcribes them <hi>by their taking Uſury and Increaſe,</hi> Ezek. 22. 12. Where, by the by, we may do well to take notice of one of the angrieſt Phraſes that I think do occur in all the Scripture, <hi>Ver. 13. Behold therefore I have ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my hands at thy diſhonest Gain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Commands are very plain and expreſs, one would think, theſe Promiſes very great and precious, and theſe Threatnings very dreadful. He had need of the reaſon of an Angel certainly, who ſhall go about to evade <hi>the ſure Word of Propheſie.</hi> And yet how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever theſe things are delivered, there is this further to be obſerv'd in the delivery of them, that both in that <hi>25<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     </hi> of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and <hi>5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

Is there any man in the World who would in cold blood be content
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:107613:170"/> that this ſhould be predicated of him? A like obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be made from both thoſe Texts in <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> How light a matter ſoever this licentious and wanton Age makes of <hi>Uſury,</hi> ſcarce aſſigning it a place amongſt the Venial Sins, and poor Peccadillo's of Life, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Prophet ranks it with, and, for ought I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, makes it equal in complexion and ſtature, to <hi>Diſhonouring of Parents, Oppreſſion, Prophaneneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This then ſeems to be our Saviour's Doctrine, <hi>That his Followers ſhould not be Uſurers.</hi> Now I will a little conſider his Diſcipline; And that I find was very ſevere againſt <hi>Uſurers,</hi> reproving them, ſpoiling their Trade, and caſting them out of the Temple. The Story is very famous, confirmed by the mouth of four Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even every one of the Evangeliſts, <hi>Mat. 12. Mark 11. Luke 19. John</hi> 2. There was good care taken, we ſee, that this paſſage ſhould not be forgotten. And our Saviour's zeal in this thing is very remarkable, I think I may ſay ſingular: For I do not remember that ever elſe he exerciſed ſuch Diſcipline upon any ſort of men; that he ever beat any man beſides, nor reform'd Abuſes thus with his own hands. The Diſciples might well take notice of it indeed, as a ſingular piece of Zeal, when they ſaw their Maſter, a meek, peaceable perſon, who never us'd to concern himſelf in other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor intermeddle in their affairs, though ſometimes Courted to it; and one that would rather pay money wrongfully, than give any offence: when they ſaw him beſtir himſelf, and make ſuch a buſtle in the Temple, overturning Tables and Seats, ſcattering money up and down, driving out Men and Beaſts with a Scourge made by his own hands. But here the Learned <hi>Uſurer</hi> (and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:107613:172"/> indeed they ſay ſome Learned men are <hi>Uſurers</hi>) Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticizes upon the words <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which we Tranſlate <hi>Money-Changers;</hi> and tell us, that they ſignifie ſuch perſons as ſate uſually in the Market, and at this time profanely in the Temple, to change greater money into ſmaller, for the convenience of Buyers and Sellers. I believe the words ſignifie thus, and the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of them imports as much; but yet theſe Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks themſelves (as <hi>Ravanallus</hi> for example) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that theſe men did <hi>quaeſtum facere,</hi> make a gain of their Changing, or Lending, or whatſoever it was. <hi>Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> indeed are very modeſt, they will ſcarce own their own name at this day; and I ſuppoſe they might be ſomewhat ſhie then, rather chuſing to be denominated from their Changing money, than from letting out to <hi>Uſury.</hi> But yet it is very plain, That theſe Money-Merchants here ſpoken of, that had their Tables in the Temple, were <hi>Uſurers,</hi> letting out their own, or other mens money, for advantage. This is the conſtant ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word <hi>Trapezitae,</hi> or <hi>Table-men,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Authors, does juſtifie; and not only in them, but in the Holy Goſpel too, which tells us almoſt <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> that they were <hi>Uſurers,</hi> Mat. 25. 27. <hi>Thou oughteſt to have put my Money to Exchange,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but though theſe Changers of money be granted to be <hi>Uſurers,</hi> yet ſay the <hi>Theological Uſurers,</hi> (and indeed they ſay that ſome Divines alſo are <hi>Uſurers) The Severity that they met with from our Saviour, was not becauſe they were Uſurers, but becauſe they prophan'd the Temple with their Tables: For how harmleſs a thing ſoever Uſury is, though it be as innocent as Doves, yet it is not fit that either it or they ſhould come into the Holy Temple.</hi> I confeſs with the Apoſtle, it is true, <hi>There is
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:107613:173"/> no agreement between the Table of the Lord, and the Table of Devils:</hi> But yet if we look well into our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's behaviour in this Act, we ſhall find, that as by his overthrowing their Tables, and thruſting them out, he chaſtiſed their Prophaneneſs; ſo by his verbal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof he taxes their very Employment, calling them a Company of Thieves, <hi>Mat. 21. 13. Ye have made it a Den of Thieves.</hi> This [<hi>Ye</hi>] cannot be meant of the Buyers and Sellers: Buying and Selling is a very warrantable thing, eſpecially ſure when it relates to the ſervice of God, as theirs did. Beſides, Chriſt gave them their Leſſon by themſelves, as St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, John 2. 16. <hi>Make not my Fathers houſe an houſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe.</hi> It remains then that the [<hi>Ye</hi>] muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the <hi>Uſurers,</hi> whom he ranks among Thieves. If any Body has a mind to ſolve the matter, and ſay, <hi>Perhaps they were not honest Uſurers,</hi> I am of the ſame mind; and ſo, at laſt, we are unawares agreed.</p>

                  <p>FOR my own part, I do not pretend to be a perſon of great Reading: But I have read the Books of ſome men, who have read many Books; and I verily think by what I have found in them, that the very quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of Books againſt <hi>Uſury,</hi> would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves make a conſiderable Book. But I am reſolv'd not to large here, as depending rather upon the ſure Teſtimony already brought. As for my ſelf, I think if I had never ſo great a mind to a thing, and plauſible Arguments for it too, I ſhould hardly adventure upon a thing ſo univerſally condemn'd both by Heathens and Chriſtians, and theſe both Papiſts and Proteſtants, Councils, Fathers, and Modern Divines of the greateſt
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:107613:173"/> Reputation. The General Councils of <hi>Agatha,</hi> the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, the firſt Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> the firſt and ſecond of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the <hi>Eleberitan</hi> Council, the Council of <hi>Towres,</hi> and the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, with others, are cited to this purpoſe, as condemning and cenſuring <hi>Uſurers</hi> more or leſs. The beſt Recorders of the matters of Primitive Times aſſure us, <hi>That the Perſon ſuſpected of Uſury, was deny'd the Common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations in the Streets, and the Kiſs of Charity in the Church; his Houſe, uſually call'd the Seat of Satan, and it was held unlawful ſo much as to fetch Fire from thence.</hi> But how much Fire is fetch'd from thence now adays, even to the conſuming of the Houſes, and Land too, of them that fetch it! It were endleſs almoſt to quote the Paſſages out of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers condemning <hi>Uſury,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Baſil, Gregory Nyſſen, Gregory Nazianzen, Chryſoſtom, Tertullian, Lactantius, Ambroſe, Jerome, Auguſtine,</hi> and many others. The Canon Law contained in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, and the Civil Law, gives the ſame Verdict: And our Statute Law, both in the time of the <hi>Britains, Saxons</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> until <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, is to the ſame purpoſe; for which I refer any one that has a mind to be particularly acquainted, to Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi>'s Book written upon this Subject.

                  <p>If this vehement Teſtimony ſhould be leſs regarded, as being the Teſtimony of an Old-faſhioned Divine, as poſſibly ſome Novices will ſpeak; I will add a very late and learned one, a Profeſſor of Divinity, a profeſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt, whoſe learned Determinations in other Caſes, are taken for Oracles, even by thoſe very men, who refuſe to hearken to him in this.

                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:107613:175"/> having told us, That moſt of the Learned have concluded <hi>Uſury</hi> ſimply unlawful, delivers his own judgment preſently after in theſe words: <hi>The Texts of Scripture are ſo expreſs, and the Grounds of Reaſon ſo ſtrong against all Uſury, that when I weigh theſe on the one ſide, and on the other ſide, how nothing at all that is, which I ever yet ſaw, or heard alledg'd to the contrary, I cannot find in my ſelf Charity enough to abſolve any kind of Uſury, with what Cautions or Circumſtances ſoever qualify'd, from being a Sin.</hi> And again, towards the end of that Diſcourſe, he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>It were not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Uſurers ſhould be ſo bitterly inveigh'd against by ſober Heathen Writers, ſo ſeverely cenſur'd by the Civil and Canon Laws, ſo Uniformly condemn'd by Godly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, ſo univerſally hated by all men of all Sorts, and in all Ages and Countries,</hi> (here upon the Margin he quotes <hi>Jer. 15. 10) as Hiſtories and Experience manifest they ever have been and are, if their Practice and Calling had been any way profitable, and not indeed every way hurtful and incommodious both to Private Men, and Publick Societies.</hi>

And here in the firſt place, if I had a mind to eſpouſe a Party, I might juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſince the Word of God hath ſo plainly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently condemned, forbidden and threatned <hi>Uſury,</hi> with what Confidence any mortal Man can or dare juſtifie it, leſt he ſhould be found <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the great
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:107613:176"/> Doctor of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſometimes argued; and might ask with the great Apoſtle, <hi>Who art thou, O man, that repliest,</hi> and campleſt <hi>against God?</hi> Shall the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture demand of the Creator a reaſon of his Law? that were bold. But ſhall he ſeek out Reaſons to evacuate and make void his Lawes? that is Rebellious. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſomewhere ſays, <hi>That as many things are forbidden becauſe they are evil, ſo ſame things are evil becauſe forbidden.</hi> Whether it be ſo or on, I cannot determine; but ſure I am, <hi>That all things are evil that are forbidden.</hi> And cannot God have a reaſon of his Laws, except we can comprehend it? Are not his Thoughts higher than our thoughts; his Thoughts of Commanding, higher than our thoughts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving? And if we have not ſo much Wit as to ſee a reaſon of every Divine Command, yet we ought to have ſo much Grace, as to think there may be a reaſon which we do not ſee. Alas! Degenerate Man is apt to make his own Luſt and Intereſt the Standard of Right and Wrong, but the Supreme Mind is the Fountain of Truth and Goodneſs, and beſtows Reality and Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence on all things: So that a thing is therefore true and good, becauſe comprehended by this infinite uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Wiſdom and Will. If there were no evil Luſts in Men, there would be <hi>no Ufury, no Oppreſſion, no Unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful or Covetous Practices:</hi> And whil'ſt there are theſe Luſts, there ſhall be no Law againſt Unmercifulneſs or Covetouſneſs, which they will not quarrel at. And no wonder, for I have run over the Ten Commandments, thoſe plain words, which for their Authority, <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, <hi>Were written with the Finger of God;</hi> and for their plainneſs, one might ſay, <hi>Were written with a Beam of the Sun.</hi> And I find there is never an one of them, but the Wit of Man has been nibling at it. One may ſafely ſay, <hi>That not only a third part of the Stars
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:107613:176"/> of Heaven have been aſſaulted by this Dragons Tail, but that there is not a Star in the Scripture Firmament which has not been ſtruck at thereby:</hi>

                  <q>Et ſi non cecidit potuit cecidiſſe videri.</q>
                  <p>I think it is a paſſage of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s ſomewhere, <hi>If it were enough to be Accuſed, no one ſhould be Innocent.</hi> And I think it is as proper to ſay, <hi>If it be Confutation enough for a Law or Doctrine to be queſtioned and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled at, nothing in the Scripture ſhall be true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe Men will cry out and clamour if they be not heard, I will hear what is ſaid, and ſuppoſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that I think may be ſaid in defence of <hi>Uſury;</hi> ſo long as the Texts ſtand Tranſlated againſt <hi>Uſury</hi> in our Bibles as they do, moſt Men are ſo modeſt or ſo wary, that they think it not worth the while to go about to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of <hi>Uſury,</hi> till theſe Texts be undermined: And therefore the firſt attempt is to prove, <hi>That Uſury is not condemned in thoſe Texts of the Old Teſtament, that men think do condemn it.</hi> The next is to prove, <hi>That though it be condemned in the Old Teſtament, yet it is not in the New.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To prove that <hi>Uſury</hi> is not ſimply condemned in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> it is vehemently urged, that the word <hi>Neſhek,</hi> ſignifies <hi>Biting and Oppreſſing Uſury;</hi> this they are content ſhould be condemned, but this does not hurt the <hi>Uſury,</hi> that does not hurt. Knock out the Teeth of that <hi>Uſury</hi> that has none, and ſpare not.</p>
                  <p>To this is anſwered, <hi>That all Uſury does in one degree or other hurt, if it be compared to Charity; and that the whole kind of it is born Toothed, though ſome ſorts of it have ſharper Teeth than others.

                  <p>But yet allowing that the word <hi>Neſhek,</hi> ſignifies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Biting,</hi> or <hi>Oppreſſing Uſury,</hi> can any man infer, <hi>That therefore there is any Uſury that is not Biting.</hi> Would not any good <hi>Grammarian</hi> rather conclude, <hi>That all Uſury is Biting, becauſe the general word that ſignifies Uſury, comes from a Root that ſignifies to Bite.</hi> I think it as ſhrewd an Argument againſt <hi>Uſury,</hi> as <hi>Grammar</hi> can furniſh a Man with, that it is called <hi>Neſhek.</hi> As it is a good Argument in <hi>Grammar,</hi> that the nature of an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locaust,</hi> is to be laid upon the Altar, and to aſcend up towards Heaven in the ſmoke, being conſumed with the Fire, becauſe <hi>Gnolah,</hi> the word that ſignifies <hi>a whole Burnt-offering,</hi> comes from <hi>Gnalah, to aſcend:</hi> And that the nature of an <hi>Alms</hi> is to proceed from <hi>Pity</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and that every <hi>Alms</hi> ſhould do ſo, becauſe the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> that ſignifies <hi>Alms,</hi> comes from a Root that ſignifies <hi>Mercy,</hi> with Thouſands more of the like nature in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> If any Argument can be drawn from the Notion of the word, it will be this, <hi>That all Uſury is as certainly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as that it is the nature of a Serpent to creep.</hi> And indeed for <hi>creeping</hi> and <hi>ſtinging,</hi> I know not how one ſhould bring a fitter word to match <hi>Neſhek; Ubi credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor mordet cum exigit quod non dedit, debitor mordetur cum reddit quod non accepit.</hi> Buxtorf.</p>
                  <p>But Laſtly, Suppoſing by <hi>Neſhek,</hi> that <hi>oppreſſive Uſury</hi> be only condemned, and that there is ſome <hi>Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> that is not ſo; yet I hope the word <hi>Tarbith</hi> is of an innocent Extraction, coming from a Verb that ſignifies
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:107613:177"/> to multiply, and yet this is as flatly condemn'd as the ſtinging <hi>Neſhek, Lev.</hi> 25. 36. and the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> makes no difference, but ſtill cries <hi>Neſhek Ultarbith,</hi> Ezek. 18. 8. 22. 12.</p>
                  <p>But however, ſay the Defendants, Uſury is only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden towards the Poor by the Law, therefore it is permitted towards the Rich; by which it appears that it is not ſimply and abſolutely forbidden.</p>
                  <p>It is confeſt that the poor are nam'd in <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. but it muſt alſo be remembered that elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where there is no mention of the poor at all, but the prohibition is general: The Pſalmiſt and the Prophets ſay nothing of the poor, but flatly and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception condemn Uſury. Secondly, It may truly be ſaid, that any man, even a rich man, when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd for his neceſſary occaſions to borrow of his Neighbour, is <hi>Pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> as they ſpeak, for that preſent time poor.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The poor are therefore nam'd when they are nam'd, becauſe they are the people neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to borrow, and moſt ſubject to oppreſſion. He that argues thus, Uſury is only forbidden towards the Poor, therefore it is permitted towards the Rich, may as well argue, from the words next before, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 22. We are onely forbidden to afflict the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and the Fatherleſs, therefore we are allow'd to do what w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We are forbidden to cauſe the blind to wander out of the way, therefore we may ſafely miſguide any that have Eys in their heads. What ſtrange work would ſuch kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing make? We are commanded plainly in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 7. to lend to our poor Brother; therefore (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Mens Logick) we are not to lend to the Rich: Well be it ſo: Now when we lend to the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:107613:178"/> poor, we are expreſly charged (<hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 25.) to take no Uſury of them: it will neceſſarily follow then that no Uſury at all is lawful.</p>
                  <p>In a word, if it be good Logick or Divinity, to ſay, Such a man is a rich man, Uſury will not much hurt him, it will indifferently ſerve to juſtifie the Robber as well as the Uſurer: and the ingenious <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Bracy</hi> ſhall go nigh to be Cannoniz'd.</p>

                  <p>THe next attempt, is to prove, That though Uſury ſhould be condemn'd in the Old Teſtament, yet it is not in the New. I have already proved Uſury forbidden in the New Teſtament, both by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and practice of that Holy Author of that Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and proved that this is no good Argument, though it could not be prov'd; the Allegation that I am now to conſider is this, There is no intrinſick Evil in Uſury, the Laws againſt it are onely Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, binding the people of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and no further concern us, than as oppreſſion is found therein. And this is further prov'd by this, that Uſury was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Jews</hi> towards Strangers.</p>
                  <p>As for the former part of this Argument; it is <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis dictum,</hi> that the Law againſt Uſury was judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. And methinks it ſhould make any man of any tenderneſs of Conſcience, vehemently ſuſpect, that there is ſomething immoral in Uſury, when he finds it ranked by the Pſalmiſt and the Prophet (Men of more than Legal minds) amongſt the moſt notorious Immoralities, ſuch as Idolatry and Murder. What
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:107613:178"/> if any Papiſt or other ſhould ſay, <hi>That the Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Worſhipping of Images, and of keeping one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both in a Week, were only Judicial and concern'd the Jewiſh Politie onely;</hi> muſt theſe Commandments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loſe their morality? God forbid, is it not more reaſonable to conclude, that there is ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically evil in Uſury, <hi>becauſe the great and wiſe Law-giver has ſo flatly forbidden it, and ſo ſeverely threatned it,</hi> then to conclude there is none, becauſe we can ſee none. They ſay this Judicial Law binds no further than the Reaſons of it do bind, no further than there is oppreſſion in it. And who can tell but that God does account all Uſury to be more or leſs oppreſſive, becauſe he has forbidden all.</p>
                  <p>The gracious Lawgiver, whoſe name is <hi>Love,</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knows what are the ſeveral violations of Charity than we do, and he makes Uſury to be one, ſetting if ſo plainly in oppoſition to Charitable tending: <hi>Thou ſhalt be Charitable and lend; but thou ſhall not put to Uſury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither doth it hinder Uſury from being in its own nature evil and oppreſſive, becauſe it was permitted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to exerciſe it upon ſtrangers. There is nothing ſure more unrighteous than Stealing, and yet there was a time when the Supream Law-give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (who gives no account of his ways to us) permitted, yea and bad the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſpoil the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> And why might not he as well permit his people to ſpoil the Heathen Nations by uſurious <hi>Lending,</hi> as he had before permitted them to ſpoil the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful <hi>Borrowing;</hi> and yet Uſury remain in its own Nature oppreſſive. It would be a ſtrange boldneſs to draw into example all things that at any time God hath permitted unto men for a time, by reaſon of the hardneſs of their hearts, or diſpenſe with by vertue
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:107613:179"/> of his infinite unaccountable Prerogative, of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Rights from one to another; from <hi>Laban</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from <hi>Egyptians</hi> to <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it not more fair to infer, that if the Law onely allowed Uſury to Strangers, (who were by the juſt judgment of God to be weakened and kept under in ſlavery and poverty) the Goſpel whoſe every line breaths love and mercy, and the holy Author of it, who has broken down the Partition wall, and made all the world Brethren, do allow it towards no body at all? But if you will have ſtrangers ſtill, I hope you will not find them amongſt Chriſtians: ſo that if there be any place left for this Merchandize of Money, the Uſurer muſt tranſplant himſelf into <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> and trade there: and try whether by that merciful means he can convert any of thoſe ſtrangers unto the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If it be pleaded, <hi>That in reaſon a man may do what he will with his own, and make the best he can of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will readily be anſwer'd, That man has proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing of his own, the propriety is in God, and we are but his Stewards, and he has appointed us how we ſhall lay out his goods; he has forbidden us to uſe them intemperately, or improve them unjuſtly. No man may kill himſelf with a Sword, though it be his own, nor play the Whore-maſter with his own Maid, nor the Drunkard with his own Liquor. It is true, a man may make the beſt he can of his own Money, but not the moſt he can of it. This churliſh Principle will preclude all Charity, and juſtfie the moſt covetous Worldling, who ſhuts up his bowels againſt the poor.</p>
                  <p>They ſeem to plead ſtrangely for Uſury, who reduce it to the head of letting out to hire, and match it
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:107613:179"/> with letting out of Lands or Houſes for Rent. If they would compare it to a Mans lending his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour a Loaf of Bread, and afterwards requiring as good a Loaf back again, and a good Shiver over and above, for his eating that Loaf which he lent him to eat, it had been a fitter compariſon I think, and much more congruous. But to wave thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſſimilitudes that might be brought to ſpoil this Compariſon, there is juſt ſuch difference between letting out Land and Houſes for Rent, and Money for Uſury, as there is between a thing allow'd of God and all Men, and another thing univerſally forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. The great Law-giver I ſuppoſe will at laſt (but to our great aſtoniſhment) either ſhew us a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing reaſon for all his Commands, or convince us that his Authority was reaſon ſufficient. If any one ſay, <hi>That lending upon Uſury is an Act of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (as I have heard ſome ſay) becauſe it often proves the ſupport of Families, or at leaſt preſerves them and their Eſtates from Ruin for a Seaſon, until time and induſtry have wrought out better fortunes for them. I will not ſay with Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> that this relief is as if a man ſhould pull out the Eye, to cure a blemiſh in the ſight, and that Uſerers are ſo neceſſary to men, as a ruſt is to Iron; nor with St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that ſuch is the kindneſs of Uſurers, that they undoe thoſe whom they help; comparing them therefore to the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> that embraceth kindly with his leggs, and at the ſame time ſtingeth with his Tail; whoſe poyſon alſo delights men at preſent, but afterwards kills; but I will ſuppoſe that Uſury has been accidentally beneficial even to the borrower. And yet this is no more than what the worſt things in the world have ſometimes been. Divines ſay, <hi>That the Devil himſelf has eventually ſerv'd the Salvation
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:107613:180"/> of many Souls;</hi> though I ſuppoſe no body ever yet juſtifi'd the Piety of his intentions, or commended the juſtneſs of his methods. But to ſpeak plainly, it is not the Uſury, but the Lending that has been found beneficial. Lending indeed is a great Act of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo neceſſary, that as the world ſtands, it could ſcarce ſtand without it: But I hope there may be Lending without Uſury. If the minds of men were univerſally formed into that Charitable and Benign Temper, in which they came out of the hands of God at firſt, they would give what they could ſpare, and lend what they could not give, and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately wiſh their poor Neighbour what they have not to lend. In a word, they would do to others, as they would that others ſhould do to them; and then I am ſure there would be no need of ſuch a thing as Uſury, to be a Vehicle for Charity. If there be at this day a neceſſity of Uſury, it is but ſuch an one as the luſts of men have made; if there be any Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, it is to the Uſurers ſweet ſelf; it begins at home, and we muſt thank the providence of God more than the kind intention of the Uſurer, if it do not end there too: for I durſt make any Uſurer his own Caſuiſt here, to ſay what is his Predominant Conſideration in his Uſurious Contracts, the relief of his Neighbour, or his own gratification.</p>
                  <p>But is there any reaſon why another man ſhould make gainful Purchaſes or Bargains with my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and I not ſhare with him in the gain? To this is anſwer'd, that there is no reaſon to enforce me to lend my Money to make other men Rich, the poor are the object of lending as well as of giving. To lend to the rich to make them ſtill Richer, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like giving to the poor, to make them Idle.</p>
                  <p>But if you have ſuch an exceſſive kindneſs for a
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:107613:180"/> Rich Friend, that you will make him ſtill Richer, you may either lend him your Money freely, or ſhare with him in the hazzard, and ſo for ought I know you may ſafely ſhare with him in the gain.</p>
                  <p>But can God <hi>ſpread a Table in the Wilderneſs; can he provide for Orphans, without this ingenious expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of Uſury?</hi> Yes ſure he can: and they have the greateſt ſecurity imaginable that he will; for he has as it were taken them into his own Attributes, ſtiling himſelf the Father of the Fatherleſs.</p>
                  <p>However there are many ways of paying <hi>Paul</hi> and not rob <hi>Peter</hi> to do it, many ways of ſecuring and improving the Portions of Orphans, and not be beholden to Uſury. And if there were none, it were better that all the Orphans in the World broke, than that the Commands of God ſhould be broke: <hi>Fait Juſtitia etiam ruente Coelo.</hi>

This, I ſay, at the firſt ſight, may ſeem ſtrange; the moſt charitable Author in the Goſpel ſhould make void the Law in this point of Charity, who in all other things of Morality perfected and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it; that he that made angry words, and luſtful looks, to be Murder and Adultery, which never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were taken to be ſo, ſhould make <hi>Uſury</hi> not to be unlawful, which ever before was taken to be ſo.

The meaning of the Parable then, is the ſame with that of the unjuſt Steward in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. and they are both no more than this, that if the men of this world are ſo ſet upon the world, that they will maintain and increaſe their Eſtates even by Uſury and Knavery, it will be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand ſhame for Children of Light not to improve the Grace of God, and work out their own ſalvation with great Zeal and Diligence, and the Covetouſneſs and Craftineſs of earthly Mammoniſts about ſo mean a thing as an Eſtate or Livelihood, will at laſt condemn the coldneſs and careleſneſs of profeſſing Chriſtians about the important matters of Eternity. This is plainly the Scope of the Parable, which alone can be formed into a Doctrine: But if any witty Uſurer will needs raiſe Doctrines from the Parabolical Phraſe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:107613:181"/> and Mode of Speech, let him preach thoſe two which I named at firſt, and let him add this third Doctrine, which ſeems moſt naturally to flow from the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Illative in the 27th <hi>verſe, That is it the manner and property of covetous and unjuſt men, to improve their money by Uſury.</hi> View the Context well, and ſee whether this be not the moſt natural Doctrine, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I reap where I ſowed not, and gather where I have not strew'd:</hi> That is, thou knew'ſt that I was a Greedy, Griping, Unjuſt Man; what then? How ſhouldſt thou have behav'd they ſelf, according to this apprehenſion that thou had'ſt of me? Why, thou oughteſt therefore to have put out my Money to Uſury. Now if any man will confeſs himſelf to be an unjuſt and rapacious Perſon, let him take Uſury by the authority of this Text; for it is of theſe alone that the Text declares, that it is their manner to put their Money to the Exchangers.</p>
                  <p>The Humane Authority that is brought for Uſury, is the Law of the Land, and ſome modern Writers.</p>
                  <p>As for the Law of Land, it is fit that great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ſhould be had thereunto; and it is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pities, that ſo ſacred a thing as that ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh Iniquity. But what, does this Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Uſury? No, that is not pretended. Does it allow it? Yea it ſeems to allow it, inaſmuch as it limits, and reſtrains it. This is no concluding Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If a Phyſician ſay to his Patient, <hi>You muſt not drink above ſuch a quantity of Wine, it will be your death if you do;</hi> it does not follow that he may ſafely drink ſo much: to may be for all that, that the Phyſician had rather he drunk none at all. I have not ſeen the Statute of the Queen, but I have read in good Authors, that that Statute forbids all Uſury, and afterwards lays a great Penalty upon all thoſe
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:107613:182"/> that exceed ſuch a meaſure. This amounts but to a very weak allowance. But ſuppoſe the Law of the Land had more expreſly allow'd Uſury for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mens hearts, and for preventing the greater Exactions and Oppreſſions; 'tis onely in purſuance of that known ſtate Maxime, <hi>Better an inconvenience than a miſchief.</hi> What if Uſury be, and be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. What if it be every where and ſuffer'd; ſays Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in the afore-quoted place? So the Devil is every where, and ſuffer'd: and ſo are the <hi>Stews</hi> ſuffer'd in <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Lombardy, Naples, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> The <hi>Canaanites</hi> were among the People of God, and ſuffered: but they were as <hi>Goads</hi> in their ſides, and Thorns in their Eyes. As theſe was ſuffer'd and as the Stews and ſuffer'd, and as the Devil is ſuffer'd, ſo, and no otherwiſe are Uſurers.</p>
                  <p>But above all Arguments and Authorities, the Authority of ſome Modern Divines of great Note, has given the greateſt Encouragement to the Practice of Uſury. It cannot be deny'd but that <hi>Calvin, Bucer, Zanchy,</hi> and ſome other Divines of late, have ſpoken favourably of Uſury, and have found out ſome diſtinctions to juſtifie ſome kinds thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all the Learned Fathers that went before them. I will not ſtand to conſider what neceſſities in time of perſecution put them upon this great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but will a little conſider of Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> mind in this matter; and then what a kind of Uſury, and how qualified it muſt be, that he allows.</p>
                  <p>It is very evident that <hi>Calvin</hi> had much rather there were no Uſury in the World then any, by what he ſays in one of his Epiſtles, <hi>In Rep. bene Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituta,</hi> &amp;c. In a well conſtituted Common-wealth, no Uſury is to be endur'd; but ought altogether to be
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:107613:182"/> caſt out of the Society of Men: To practice Uſury is a diſingenuous way of Trading, and unbecoming a Pious and Honeſt Man. In his Harmony upon the Pentateuch, I read theſe words, <hi>Fieri vix poteſt quin foeno nis exactione exhauriantur inopes, &amp; prope exugatur eorum ſanguis.</hi> Again, <hi>Permiſſum fuit gentibus foene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari, quod diſcrimen Lex Spiritualis non admittit.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Certe minime vid etur licitum filiis Dei, quod prophani quo<expan>

                  <p>And after he had given his Opinion that all Uſury without exception is not to be condemn'd, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd ſome Uſury, ſo it be exercis'd according to that Golden Rule, Do not to another what thou would'ſt not ſhould be done to thy ſelf; and had laid down two Caſes wherein he thinks Uſury lawful (which I will relate hereafter) fearing leſt any one ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelf too far from what he had ſaid, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim quidem meo patrocinio Uſuras fovere, at<expan>

                  <p>To make Uſury Lawful, he lays down theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That a man do not make a Trade or a Cuſtom of it.</item>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:107613:183"/>
                     <item>2. That it be not practis'd upon the Needy.</item>
                     <item>3. If a man be not ſo addicted to gain, but that he be still ready furniſh't, and willing to furniſh his poor Neighbour freely.</item>
                     <item>4. That the Rule of Chriſt be ever our Touch-ſtone, to deal no otherwiſe then we would be dealt with.</item>
                     <item>5. That the Borrower's Gain be ſo much more at leaſt as the Uſurers Intereſt comes to.</item>
                     <item>6. That no prejudice be done to the Common-wealth.</item>
                     <item>7. That which never exceeds the Stint ſet by the Law.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And <hi>Zanchy</hi> another Patron of Uſury, ſays that the Uſury which he himſelf and <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> defended, was to be thus qualified, that if it appear the Borrower doth gain little or nothing, and if he loſe of the Principal, thou muſt bear part of the loſs.</p>
                  <p>And now I wiſh that every one that takes encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the Arguments of theſe Divines to practice Uſury, would conſcientiouſly obſerve their Reſtrictions alſo in practiſing of it; and then I believe that though Uſury ſhould be found never ſo lawful, yet there would be no Uſurers.</p>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXXIII.</hi> What Uſurers are Lovers of the World.</head>
                  <p>ACcording to my method propounded, it now onely remains to ſhew what Uſurers are Lovers of the World. But this I cannot well do, till I have premis'd, that ſome things are abuſively call'd Uſury, or that all things are not Uſury that look like it, or are called by that Name. In the laſt Meditation I had occaſion to quote out of <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi>
                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:107613:183"/> that his opinion was, that there are ſome kinds of Uſury lawful; and he names to: I am wholly of his opinion, that thoſe two things are juſt and lawful; but here I differ from him, I do not think they are proporly Uſury. So that although theſe two things be lawful, yet ſtill all Uſury may remain unlawful. The things he inſtances in are theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To receive ſatisfaction for the loſs or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, that I have really ſuffer'd by a mans keeping my Money, beyond the time that I lented it him, for it is juſt that the Borrower ſhould repay my loſs that I ſuſtain for his ſake and by his fault. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> ſpeaking of the difference between Uſury and Intereſt, confeſſes Intereſt to be lawful, which he explains thus, <hi>I lend my Neighbour Twenty pound freely without Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſuch a day, for I am then to pay it upon an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of my own, I have no more but this, and if I fail of payment, I must forfeit Five pounds.</hi> This Neighbour fails me, whereby I loſe Five Pounds. If I require that Five Pounds of him, it is Intereſt, not Uſury, and its juſt. In Uſury I ſeek to be a gainer; in Intereſt, I onely ſeek to be no loſer, which ſtands with Equity and Conſcience. But then this loſs of mine muſt be really ſuſtain'd: For ſays <hi>Calvin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the place afore cited, <hi>Semper excogitant homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes aſtuti capti unculas quibus deum illudant,</hi> &amp;c. Thus, whereas all men abhorr'd the name of Uſury, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name was found to eſcape the odium by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt colour, and ſo they call it Intereſt, as if it were onely a compenſation of their loſs, <hi>Quanti intererat pecuniae ſuae uſu carere.</hi> But there is no kind of Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which men may not put this ſpecious pretence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: for whoſoever has preſent Money, when he is to lend it, will pretend it may be profitable to him to buy, or trade, or get ſome kind of gain
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:107613:184"/> withal daily, ſo there will always be place for compenſation, when no Creditor can lend his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without loſs. Thus the name of Intereſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth, 'tis the ſame with Uſury, is the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an odious matter. But alas that ever men ſhould think by Cavil to elude the Judgment of God, where integrity alone can be our defence. The <hi>Jews</hi> did prevaricate partly after the ſame manner, the word <hi>Neſhek</hi> that comes from biting ſounded very harſh: therefore becauſe no man was willing to be accounted a hungry Dog, that fed himſelf by biting others; they found out a Sanctuary for their ſhame, they call'd it <hi>Tarbith,</hi> that is, increaſe. But God to meet with theſe Fallacies, condemns Uſury both by the name of biting and increaſe, <hi>Lev. 25. 36. Ezek.</hi> 18. 12. God does antervert all vain excuſes, and in general condemns <hi>Quamlibet ſortis acceſſionem,</hi> whatever is more than the principal.</p>
                  <p>I have the more fully tranſcrib'd the words of this Author, becauſe he is taken to be a Patron of Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to obviate that old thred bare Argument For Uſury, of <hi>Damnum ex lucro ceſſante.</hi> To ſay I have really ſuſtained damage, by not having my Money paid at my time prefixt, and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſatisfaction for that damage, is good Senſe, and good Divinity, for ought I know; but it is not Uſury: but to ſay I have ſuſtained damage becauſe I might poſſibly have gain'd by that Money ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, is not good Logick; for that which may be, may alſo not be: neither is it good Divinity, that therefore I ſhould oblige my Neighbour or his Heirs, to make me a ſatisfaction for the want of this poſſible gain; for I might have Traffic'k with my Money, and poſſibly I might have loſt by ſo doing: and does not the avoiding of a poſſible loſs ſufficiently
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:107613:184"/> recompence the loſs of a poſſible gain. The poſſible, but uncertain hopes of gain, which either the Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or the Borrower do conceive, muſt not ſet the rate and value upon the the thing lent, but the preſent intrinſical worth of it.</p>
                  <p>The other thing that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> inſtances in as a ſort of lawful Uſury is, <hi>If I lend a rich Man a part of a great Sum of Money to buy Land with, may I not receive a proportionable part of the actual Rents, or profits of Land, till my Money be repaid me?</hi> This he ſays is lawful, and I know no body that denies it; but I deny it to be Uſury: it looks rather like a kind of Partnerſhip, or Temporary joynt purchaſing.</p>
                  <p>Nay if a man will lend his Money to another for any gainful uſe, and runs the hazard of the Principal, he may, for ought I know, without Uſury, warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably contract for an equitable part of the Gain, when it ſhall be actually received, allowing for the pains and charge of the Borrowers in managing it.</p>
                  <p>If a man, weary of the buſineſs of the World, will give his ſtock of money to another, engaging him to maintain him whil'ſt he lives, he parts with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, it is a Gift with a condition, <hi>it is no Uſury,</hi> ſays Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> in his fore-quoted Comment upon 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>I will add further, That to receive a Gratification or Acknowledgment in any kind for money, or other things lent, is not in its own nature Uſurious, nor ſimply unlawful. God never intended to bind men up from Gratitude, nor to forbid them to render one good turn for another. If my Neighbour lend me money freely and charitably, and I happen to be advantaged, and much be-friended by his courteſie, and am ſo grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ingenuous, as to requite his kindneſs in any thing wherein I can, and do it freely, without his contracting
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:107613:185"/> for it, or requiring it, I cannot underſtand how my Gratitude ſhould make him an Uſurer, ſo long as his Lending was freely, and my Acknowledgment uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and unconſtrain'd.</p>
                  <p>So that in ſtead of ſaying there are ſome ſorts of Uſury lawful, let us ſay there are ſome lawful things that look like Uſury, yet are not it, and we are all agreed.</p>
                  <p>But if we would know who are the worldly Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, (though I do not excuſe any from being ſo) it is evident that theſe that follow are of that ſort:</p>
                  <p>Such as exceed the Limits of the Laws of the Land either directly or indirectly; who, unto Uſury, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>add thoſe Monſters of Procuration and Continuation, commit Iniquity to be puniſhed by the Judge, and are accounted Oppreſſors even by the modeſter ſort of Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
                  <p>For a Man (eſpecially a Divine) to require Uſury, where no profit has been made of the Principal, yea, where the very Principal has miſcarry'd; and that of his Friend, to whom he is beholden, and to extort it too, every one will ſay is a black Character: But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps few believe that there is any ſuch; neither ſhould I, if I had not ſeen and known them.</p>
                  <p>To make a Trade of Uſury, and to get ones Living out of the Sweat of other Mens Brows, is condemned for an idle wicked Life, even by the favourableſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, yea, by the very Patrons of Uſury.</p>
                  <p>To bind Men and their Friends, and their Heirs and Executors, to make a certain advantageous Return of an uncertain hazardous Employment of money, is very Cruel, and an Atheiſtical confronting of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>To be content our Neighbor ſhould be ſubjected to all Caſualties, and to take no further care but to ſecure
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:107613:185"/> our own profit, is filthily ſelfiſh, and ſomewhat like the ill condition'd Generation, of whom Chriſt Jeſus complain'd; who laid great and heavy burdens upon the backs of others, which they themſelves refus'd to touch with the leaſt of their Fingers.</p>
                  <p>To ſeek our own advantage or enrichment by the hurt or detriment of others, is flatly againſt the Law of Lovers, and the Golden Rule of Charity, which the Law commends, and the Goſpel magnifies and enforces.</p>
                  <p>To make the poor pay for the uſe of Money or any other thing, which is meerly for the relief of their neceſſities, is by the moſt favourable Interpreters granted to be directly againſt the plain Letter of the Law; even by thoſe I ſay, who allow a little ſtricter dealing with the Rich.</p>
                  <p>Let the Uſurers of <hi>England</hi> clear themſelves of theſe ſpots, if they can; if they cannot, let them ſit down with the mark of the World upon them, till they can.</p>

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:107613:186"/> is but little available in any caſe; but I am ſure in the Caſe of Religion its not available at all, without a Nature, either to the preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or future Happineſs of Men. Why a Chriſtian loving the World, is but in name onely diſtinguiſht from a Heathen. And truly methinks this is but a ſmall Honour or Conſolation either. Who can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably bleſs himſelf that he is not an Unbeliever, when in the mean time he is an Hypocrite? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will not the Heathen, adjudg'd to a more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable condemnation hereafter, bleſs himſelf that he was not a Chriſtian, and had not ſo many obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations laid upon him to forſake this World, nor ſuch clear Revelation as we have of another. It had been a goodly Errand indeed for Chriſt to come into the World, and to gather together a company of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, only to bear his Name, but really not to differ from other men, nor from what they themſelves were before. Was it worthy of his Blood, can we think, to purchaſe to himſelf a People peculiar onely in Nominal Relation? Why certainly under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Title of Chriſtians, we are ſtill Heathens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in truth, if our Predominant Love and Care be of and for the things of this World! For ſo the Heathen are deſcrib'd by our Lord himſelf, to have their minds mainly upon worldly things, <hi>Mat. 6. 32. After theſe things do the Gentiles ſeek.</hi> And he would have his Diſciples to differ from the Gentiles in their ſeekings and lovings as well as in their profeſſing.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>SEcondly,</hi> If we value our ſelves onely as men, Creatures of Noble Natures and large Capacities, let us conſider that the World with all its Trinity of Riches, Pleaſures and Honours, in Inferior and Inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to our Souls; below our Faculties, and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to our Neceſſities. 'Tis juſtly accounted diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for Perſons of Noble Extraction or Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Education to mingle themſelves with perſons, or in things mean and unſuitable to them, as if it were a debaſing and degrading of themſelves: but if this mixture be a familiarity, 'tis ſtill worſe; and if this familiarty be an Union, 'tis worſt of all. What a ſtir and a clatter do we make about a Gentleman marrying his Maid, or a Lady her Groom. Great Indignation ariſes to the Gentry of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood preſently, and much wonderment to the reſt. But the Soul of the meaneſt man, matching with the moſt ſplendid Object in the Creation, and uniting its ſelf thereunto, incurs a far ſorer Cenſure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a far greater pity. The Sun ſtooping to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Clymene,</hi> or the Moon to the Sheperds Boy <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimion,</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> in the Arms of dirty <hi>Vulcan,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi> aſſuming Horns and Hoofs, for the ſake of a mortal Miſtreſs, or whatſoever the Poets have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the diſparagement of their wanton Deities, does but repreſent the infamous mixture which that off-ſpring of Heaven, the Soul of Man, does make of it ſelf with things terrene and mortal. A generous Eagle preying upon Carrion, or a glorious Star fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:107613:187"/> from its Sphere, and choaking it ſelf in the duſt; or the Romane Emperour catching Flies, are tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Abſurdities in comparriſon of that abominable and miſchievous Choice which all worldly minded Men in the World do make. Does the Maker of Souls, who beſt knows the worth of them, value one Soul, any one Soul againſt the whole World? And ſhall we think a little ſcantling of this World, a fit match for Millions of Souls? <hi>Doſt thou not know, O my Soul, that thou art the Son of God, the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Angels, nay even of the Angel of the Covenant by Adoption; and canst thou pitch and fix upon any Object below God himſelf?</hi> It is unreaſonable, it is unjuſt, it is ſinful and ſhameful. Believe it, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate love of thy ſelf is an <hi>Inceſtuous,</hi> and of other things a <hi>Sodomitical</hi> Conjunction.</p>
                  <p>And beſides the Relation and Capacity of Souls, we may diſtinctly conſider the wants and neceſſities of Souls, which are ſuch, that the World and the fulneſs thereof cannot ſupply or relieve. The Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Thirſts of Souls are great and ſtrong, which the Creatures Ciſtern can never ſlake and quench. There is a kind of infinity in the luſtings and cravings of Souls, which all the Poſſeſſions and Conqueſts of the World could never yet fully gratifie; <hi>Curtae neſcio quid ſemper abeſt rei.</hi> You may as well imagine that <hi>Behemoth</hi> that drinketh up <hi>Jordan</hi> into his mouth, ſhould be ſatisfi'd with one drop of a Bucket, or the wrangling of a hungry Infant for the full Breaſt, ſhould be from day to day ſilent by Gawds and Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; as that the Thirſts of a Soul which are after Reſt and Happineſs, ſhould be quencht and ſatisfi'd by Creature fulneſs. No, no, the whole World is thoſe <hi>Husks,</hi> that will not fill the Belly of the Hungry <hi>Prodigal:</hi> Take it in all its dimenſions, and a Man may
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:107613:188"/> ſay of it, <hi>The Bed is too ſhort for a Soul to ſtretch it ſelf upon, and the Covering is too narrow for a Soul to wrap it ſelf in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I may add, That the Heart of Man is alſo a Sacred Thing, a Thing Conſecrate to God. The Prophanation of Temples was ever bann'd, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was never ſo tranſported with Zeal, as againſt the Profaners of the Temple; but certainly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the World into our Hearts is greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, than to drive a Trade in the Temple, to make a Dove Houſe or a Stable of it.</p>

                  <p>THe uncertainty and unſatisfyingneſs of the World, and all worldly things, is a popular Theme, which every young Scholar can Rhetoricate upon and declaim againſt, before he have made any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of it, or any Choice of a better Object. The Books of Men are as full of Invectives againſt the World, as their Hearts are at the ſame time of the love of it. He's a very fool indeed that cannot repeat the words of the wiſe Man, and cry all is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but he's a wiſe Man who heartily believes what he repeats, and acts agreeable to his belief.</p>
                  <p>The Poetical Fancies do prettily reſemble pleaſures to <hi>Syrenes,</hi> which ſing ſweetly, and by their pleaſant voice and beautiful aſpect, allure the Paſſenger to themſelves, and then hugg him and kill him. And who can deny, that this is ſomewhat like to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> whoriſh Woman in the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Honour to <hi>Icarus</hi> his Wings, mounting him ſo unreaſonable high, that they are melted off by the heat,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:107613:188"/> and ſo down comes that aſpiring Mortal to a degree lower than that from which he aroſe; and leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind him, but a ridiculous fame of bold A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring, <hi>Magnis tamen excidit auſis.</hi> Not unlike which, is the deſcription that the Pſalmiſt makes of man, that is in Honour and abideth not, <hi>He ſtands upon Pinnacles indeed, but they are very ſlippery ones, from which he is ſoon cast down into deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They reſemble Riches to the great Wooden Horſe, which the ſilly <hi>Trojans</hi> entertain'd into the very heart of the City, and rejoyc'd in it as a rare Preſent, ſent them by the Gods; but it prov'd full of deadly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that preſently Murdered them in their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And does not the Apoſtle ſpeak to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when he tells us, That <hi>they that will be Rich, fall into Temptations, and a Snare, and many hurtful Luſts which drown Men in Perdition;</hi> and coveting after them, is piercing ones ſelf thorow with many Sorrows.</p>
                  <p>I have read of a Bird in ſome parts of <hi>India,</hi> that has a Note, ſinging in the language of that Countrey, <hi>Here he is.</hi> This he is always ſinging, as our Countrey Cuckows. Hereby many curious Travellers are invited to the Tree where he ſits, who ſpying them come, removes further to another, and after that to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtill calling them by the ſame Note; whereby it has happen'd that many in ſeeking to find the Bird have loſt themſelves. The Application is eaſie: for the things of this World Invite, and Allure, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe much Content, Lo <hi>Here it is,</hi> And lo <hi>There it is;</hi> but no body could ever light of it there; for when one comes near them, the deceitful Birds take to themſelves Wings, and flye away; for ſo the wiſeſt of men tells us in plain words, <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 10. He that loveth Silver ſhall not be ſatisfi'd,</hi> &amp;c. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:107613:189"/> Pleaſures, the ſame Wiſdome ſaid, That its madneſs; and of Mirth, what does it: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 2. and concerning Honour, he thought the ſame thing; for <hi>all that comes</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Meditation is capable of much enlargement, but it does not need it: Therefore I will diſmiſs it, and conſider further, Whether thoſe things be indeed Riches, Pleaſures, and Honours, which are call'd by thoſe names? I ſuppoſe that theſe things of the World are not onely empty and unſatisfying, and therefore unfit to be the Object of our Love, but that they are <hi>deceitful,</hi> in nor <hi>being</hi> what we call them, as well as in not <hi>giving</hi> what we expect from them. Shall theſe ſorry things deſerve the name of Riches, Honour, and Pleaſure, that are full of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Diſgrace, and Bitterneſs? Can I be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be Rich, when with my Riches I am poor; or Honourable, when with my Honours I am the more abject and ſlaviſh; or a man of pleaſures, when with my pleaſures I am the fadder? And is it not thus?</p>
                  <p>The true meaſure of riches is, not how much the more one has, but how much the leſs he wants; for riches were not intended only that we might have more, but that nothing ſhould be wanting. Now conſider that famous rich man in the Goſpel, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, whether he was the richer or the poorer for that plentiful Crop he reaped. This increaſe made him ſollicitous and ſleepleſs, made him more indigent then he was before; And was it not poverty then? For now the Text tells us, he wants bigger Barns, conſequently a great many Workmen to build him more, Servants and Cattel to manage his Husdandry: And I pray what can poverty it ſelf do more than make a man want? I ſuppoſe a poor man in the common
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:107613:189"/> ſenſe to be made rich; well, he wants Men and Arms to defend his riches, Servants to manage them, a Retinue to wait upon him; now he wants a Stately Houſe, and that wants Stately Furniture; he wants many other things, and thoſe things want many other things ſtill: ſo that the poverty is mightily increaſed by the mans being inrich't. And is it not thus with Honours too? Was not <hi>Haman</hi> baſe and vile with all honour, who was ſubject to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> a Captive, a Slave? If it be ſaid it was by accident; I anſwer, that all honour lies perfectly at the mercy of the People, they kill or ſave by the turning of a Thumb, as they did in the <hi>Arena</hi> of old.</p>
                  <p>It is ill provided for proud men, whoſe Greatneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon a ſmall matter, which is in the power of the meaneſt man to deny. And to be a ſervant to ſo many men, and thoſe of the meaneſt too, methinks is a great reproach. And as for pleaſure, I doubt not but that honeſt ſelf-denying <hi>Urias</hi> had more ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mind in not going home to his Wife, than <hi>David</hi> had in fetching her home to him; his denying of pleaſure was pleaſant, whereas the others pleaſure was painful and ſhameful.</p>
                  <p>And wilt thou O my Soul be impos'd upon; wilt thou be ſo childiſh as to purſue a painted and gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Butterfly; which either thou canſt not catch, or it will weary thee to catch it; or it will at laſt aſhame thee of the pains and wearineſs that thou haſt been at in catching it, when thou ſeeſt it will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thy expectations? Nay worſe, wilt thou follow a falſity, a deluſion, a ſhadow inſtead of a ſubſtance, a name inſtead of a thing? Wilt thou travel all the day in purſuit of a Notion, and at laſt it will prove nothing but a Fallacy?</p>
                  <p>Is it ſuch an admirable atchievement, after all thy
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:107613:190"/> pains, and ploddings and periclitations of health and caſe, and ſoul and all, to be falſly called rich or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable? Nay, nay, for ſtark ſhame loſe not the ſubſtance for the ſhadow, and yet not get that neither. Reckon rather, that true riches ſtand in not wanting any thing, then in having much; and not wanting depends upon not deſiring; leſſen thy deſires, and thou art truly and compendiouſly become rich. If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt many worldly things to make thee happy, thou both miſſeſt of thy happineſs (which theſe things can never afford) and looſeſt a great part of thy ſelf too in the enquiry; for look how many deſires do diſtract thee, ſo many bits and parcels of thy ſelf are wanting; every Concupiſence runs away with a piece of thee. To think to be made happy by the addition of more worldly things, is juſt as if one ſhould go about to make up an entire Garment all of Patches.</p>

                  <p>WHen I begin to think of the Nature of Love, I ſee a wide Field open, wherein I might either tire my ſelf, or loſe my ſelf. I will therefore confine my Mind to the Meditation of the Nature of Love, as it is, <hi>Giving, Transforming, Uniting, and Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> Theſe are Four famous Properties of it, to give away the mind to the Object, to aſſimulate it to it, to unite it, and to ſubject it thereunto.</p>
                  <p>From every one of which will ariſe a ſtrong Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive from the Love of the World.</p>
                  <p>He that loves gives; And what does he give? He gives his heart, he gives himſelf. The Text ſeems
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:107613:190"/> to juſtify this Notion, That predominant loving is a giving away of the Heart to any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject—<hi>My Son give me thy heart.</hi> He that predominantly loves God, gives him his heart; And it is true on the other hand, that the Covetous Man is given to the World, and the Senſualiſt is given to Pleaſures, <hi>Anima eſt ubi amat non ubi animat:</hi> The Soul that loves, ſojourns abroad all the while, and is anothers, not its own. He that loves God, gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, and dwelleth in him; which giving away of our ſelves is moſt advantageous. For in lieu of this poor gift, our ſelves, we receive God, who is infinitely better than Ten thouſand Selves: But he that by Love gives himſelf to the World, parts with the beſt he has, even himſelf, for nothing. He gives himſelf to that which can give him nothing back again, cannot ſo much as love him: In which reſpect I doubt not to affirm, that the Covetous Man is the greateſt Prodigal in the World; he parts with that which is moſt precious for no price at all. For to allude to our Saviour, he hath nothing in Exchange for his Soul.</p>
                  <p>Again, Let us a little conſider the <hi>Aſſimulating</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Love. As he that looks into a Glaſs, even by looking into it, makes a face therein; ſo he that loves, even by loving, contracts a ſimilitude. No Man loves God, but he forthwith neceſſarily becomes God-like. How precious and honourable muſt this love be then, that makes this bleſſed Transformation? And how vile and diſhonourable is that worldly love, that transforms Man into Money, nay into Muck! The Poets tell of a covetous King that turn'd all he toucht into Gold; but lo here a ſtranger ſight, the Covetous Worldling, turning even himſelf into Gold by loving it. <hi>Wouldſt thou be content, O Man, that God ſhould turn thee into Gold or Silver, into Houſe
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:107613:191"/> or Land? Why then wilt thou make this voluntary Transformation of thy ſelf?</hi> And yet ſo it is, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeſt the thing that thou loveſt; even as a lump of Braſs, Caſt and Carv'd into the ſhape of a Man, is ſaid to be a man; but cut the Effigies of a Beaſt upon it, and it will be call'd a Lion or a Dog.</p>
                  <p>Yea more than ſo, the nature of Love is not only Aſſimulating but <hi>Uniting.</hi> The Soul of Man is no otherwiſe united to any Object but by Love; this makes him as much one with God, as he is capable, if God be his beſt belov'd Object; and it makes him one with the World, if that be his darling; even one with a Whore, if he be by love joyn'd unto her. The Particles of ſome Worms cut off, ſeek to be united to the Head: ſure I am that man (who is call'd <hi>a Worm and no Man</hi>) being by his Apoſtacy cut off from God, ought ever to be enquiring after his Original, and ſeeking to be re-united to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Object from which at firſt he is ſo unhappily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the nature of all created love is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Heart to the Belov'd Object: <hi>Qui aliquo fruitur, ei neceſſe eſt ut per amorem ſubdatur.</hi> He that loves God above all, confeſſes that he needs him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all; and ſeeks to be made happy, in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſomething more excellent than himſelf is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is but reaſonable, and indeed honourable. And ſo he that loves the World Predominantly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims his need of, and dependance upon the World, in the enjoyment of which, he expects himſelf to be happy; which is unreaſonable and ſhameful. The covetous Rich Man does not ſo properly poſſeſs the World, as indeed is poſſeſt by it, the World has the command of his Heart, therefore it is his Maſter; and he is the worſt of Slaves, as giving himſelf into
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:107613:191"/> a voluntary bondage, and that to the vileſt and meaneſt of Maſters. What place in the Creation ſhall I aſſign to that man that loves the loweſt things; for by loving, he makes himſelf lower than they; and it will puzzle all Philoſophy to tell where to place that man, that is lower than the loweſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shake off theſe ſhameful Fetters, O my Soul, burſt this Yoke: thou art call'd to liberty, renounce this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable ſervitude; and reckon that if for an Hand-Maid to be Heir to her Miſtreſs, is a matter of Pride, for a Miſtreſs to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>HAving briefly conſidered what the World is, and what Love is, I will now put them together, and a little conſider what Worldly Love is. And indeed I cannot think of any thing abominable, but I find it to be that. Methinks I hear the Pathetical

I will confine my ſelf to five or ſix of the worſt that I can think of. And here I will begin this black Roll with <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is confeſt by all Chriſtians to be an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, inſomuch that that very part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World which we moſt ſuſpect of it, are as ſtudious to excuſe it, as they are bold to commit it: And there is a great deal of reaſon why all men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the knowledge of the true God, ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominate <hi>Idolatry,</hi> when they hear him in his Word ſo paſſionately charging the World againſt it, ſo terribly threatning the Commiſſion of it, and read what lamentable Devaſtations he made amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> becauſe of it; which the Prophet excuſes by a ſtrange expreſſion, <hi>The Lord could no longer bear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Idolatry, Jer.</hi> 44. 22.

The higheſt Act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is Love, conſequently, he that loves the praiſe of Men, more than the praiſe of God, that is a lover of Pleaſures more than of God, is a down right Idolater. Gold and Silver need not to be made into Images, to be objects of admiration: He that loves and delights, and truſts in them chiefly, has given the Worſhip peculiar to God to them, and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:107613:192"/> made them his God already. Idols may be, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are ſet up, as properly in the Heart as in Houſes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 3. and Idolatry as well committed, by the inclinations of the Will, as by the bending of the Knee. There cannot be more palpable Idolatry in the world, than making that a God to ones ſelf, which is none: Is not the Senſualiſt an Idolater in the moſt proper ſpeech, whoſe Belly is his God, as the Apoſtle phraſeth it. By the like propriety of ſpeech, one may ſay of the proud Gallant, that he makes his Back his God; nay an Horſe, an Hawk, or an Hound, may be as truly an Idol to a Chriſtian, as a Calf is to an <hi>Egyptian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond abominable thing that I think of, is <hi>Adul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ry.</hi> Whatever favourable Opinion this Wicked and Wanton Age has entertain'd of this Vice, I'm ſure the Holy God accounts it abominable, and ordained in his Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Adulterors ſhould be ſtoned to Death. Such is the Opinion that God has of Adultery, that he moſt uſually by his Prophets compares that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable ſin of Idolatry to it, and calls it <hi>going a Whoring after other Gods.</hi> It muſt needs be a foul pattern by which that Monſter of Idolatry is drawn.</p>
                  <p>And is not the love of the World Adultery? Is not the heart of Man as much dedicate and due to God, as any Mans Wife is peculiar to him. Do Men juſtly complain of great wrong done to them, and may not God as juſtly complain of the alienation of Hearts? May not God reaſonably be offended that ſuch a vile thing as Mundanes ſhould be his Rival, and defile the Heart of Man; which he eſteems his greateſt Jewel. It's plain by the judgement of the great Searcher of Hearts, that ſhe that luſts after another Man, more
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:107613:193"/> than her own Husband, is a Whore, and has already committed Adultery with him in her Heart. It muſt needs be, that the Soul that luſts after and cleaves to any Object more than to God (to whom Souls are moſt nearly related, and to whom they are moſt firmly bound) is abominably Unchaſt and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous in her loves. Souls have no way of playing the Whore but by miſ-loving: and by how much the meaner the Object of their love is, ſo much the groffer and more ſhameful their Adultery. So that the Soul Proſtituting it ſelf to the World, is not only <hi>Adulterous</hi> but indeed <hi>Sodomitical</hi> in this Conjuction. For tis all one with lying down before a Beaſt, which is forbidden by the law, abhorr'd of Nature, and damned by the gentile Theology, under the Fable of <hi>Paſiphae</hi> and her Bull, and their Monſtrous off ſpring, the <hi>Minotaur, Vencr is Monument a nefandae.</hi>

                     <hi>MEDITAT. XXXIX</hi> Of the Blaſphemy and Sacriledge of Worldly Love.</head>
                  <p>A Third abominable thing that I think of, is <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</hi> To ſpeak evil of God, injuriouſly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully, of the Deity, may juſtly be accounted horrible amongſt the Servants of the true God; when it was judged abominable even by the Heathens, whoſe Gods themſelves were abominable. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Companions had like to have been pull'd in pieces by the Zealous <hi>Epheſians,</hi> for diſparaging <hi>Diana:</hi> and the onely way that the Town Clark could take to appeaſe the multitude, was to tell them whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver people ſaid of her, <hi>Diana</hi> was a very brave Goddeſs; and to deny that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Companions were
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:107613:193"/> Blaſphemers of her: for he knew well enough that if ſuch a horrible thing as Blaſphemy were prov'd againſt them, the people would not have ſtay'd for any Judicial Sentence to be paſt upon them. Now, there is a Blaſphemy of the Heart as well as of the Tangue. So the Fool Blaſphemes, who ſays in his heart there is no God: and ſo do all they that either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſcribe to God what he is not, as Ignorance or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, or deny to him what he is, as Omniſcience and Omnipotence; or elſe aſcribe that to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which onely and of right belongs to him. Thus every Idolater, who gives Divine Worſhip to a Creature, is a manifeſt Blaſphemer of God; and ſo are all Predominant Lovers of the World, who by the Predominant purſuit of the World, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare they expect happineſs from the Creature, which is onely to be found in God and in the enjoyment of him. It may ſeem harſh, when 'tis ſpoken in plain words, that every covetous, proud, and ſenſual Soul is a Bla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>emer; but there is nothing truer nor ſcarce plainer. I do not ſpeak of any ſingle Act of Blaſphemy that theſe Worldlings are guilty of, but indeed they live in a conſtant and continued ſtrain of Blaſphemy. Is it not evident that all theſe Men ſeek Happineſs, Reſt, Satisfaction, in the great abundance of Worldly Things. It is obvious to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, that they do inſatiably purſue them; there can be no cauſe of this aſſign'd, but that they fancy and promiſe to themſelves ſome ſatisfaction and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the enjoyment of them: And is not this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſcribe to the Creature, that felicitating and filling Vertue, which individually belongs to the Creator? Is it not to give the Glory and Eſſence and Incommunicable Attributes of God to another? Does not he diſparage a Fountain of Living Waters,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:107613:194"/> who repairs to a broken Ciſtern, to quench his Thirſt? Does not he diſparage the nature of Bread, who paſſes it by, and ſeeks to fill his Belly with Husks? That which is a diſparagement to theſe, if it be committed againſt God, is Blaſphemy. He is the only Root and Center of Souls, and to take up in any thing below him, as an ultimate reſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, does highly diſhonour him, and plainly Blaſpheme him. How juſtly may it be anſwer'd to this Worldly Crew, at the laſt day, when finding their miſerable diſappointment, they ſhall ſeek to enter into everlaſting Reſt: <hi>I know you not, you have receiv'd your Conſolation, you have had your Reward; in your life time, you received your good things. Get ye to your Gods therefore of Gold, of Silver, and ſuch other Worldly Deities, to which all a long you Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly aſcrib'd a filling and ſatisfying Vertue.</hi>

                  <p>The poor woman in the Goſpel, that had ſpent all her Living upon Phyſicians, and could get no Cure, was indeed after admitted to a touch of the Hem of the Garment of Jeſus, and healed. But they that ſpend all their Heart upon the World, ſeeking for reſt in the things that cannot afford it, ſhall not find it, when they come to ſeek it where it is. No, no, its juſt that they that blaſphemouſly make this World their God, ſhould be diſpos'd of with the God of this World.</p>

How abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing this is, one may eaſily diſcern by thoſe Pathetical words of God himſelf, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. Where he asks as it were with wonderment: <hi>Will a Man rob God?</hi> It can ſcarce be thought that there ſhould be any ſuch bold Villany in the Nature of things. The Heathens accounted it a fearful thing to rob their god,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:107613:194"/> who indeed poſſeſt nothing. Every body know how <hi>Prometheus</hi> was faſtned to Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and had a Vulture perpetually aſſign'd to feed upon his Liver, for defrauding <hi>Jupiter</hi> at a Feaſt, putting him off with Bones cover'd with Fat, when he got the beſt Morſels to his own Trencher, and ſtealing Fire from Heaven. Which Sacriledge <hi>Jupiter</hi> did ſo much ſtomach, as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſomewhere tells the ſtory, that he thought inſtead of being bound to Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> he deſerv'd the whole Mountain to be thrown upon him, and inſtead of one Vulture, he deſerv'd ſixteen to torment him.</p>
                  <p>Are they eſteem'd to rob God, who with-held Tithes and Offerings from him; and ſhall not they be much rather ſo eſteem'd, who deny him their Hearts? Our hearts are due to God, he requires them, <hi>My Son give me thy heart;</hi> this is his great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart.</hi> The heart of man is moſt ſacred, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Temple, the living Temple of the living God: and if it be accounted abominable Sacriledge, to ſteal holy Veſſels out of the Temple; what ſhall we call it, when we ſteal the Temple it ſelf?

But I will adjourn the further Proſecution of this to ſome following Meditations, concerning motives to the Love of God, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the laſt abominable thing, which the Love of the World is, and that is <hi>Perjury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jews of our Saviours time, had very broad Conſciences, and many fowl things they made a ſhift to ſwallow, ſuch as Revenge, Hatred of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Neglect of poor Parents, and the like; yet Perjury was ſuch a Morſel as they could never get down: though they had made void many of the Commands of God, yet for ſtark ſhame they left this ſtanding in its full force, <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, but ſhalt perform to thy Lord thy Vows.</hi> What Opinion the Heathen had of Perjury, appears by the ſtrange puniſhments that they ſay the gods inflicted upon <hi>Laomedon</hi> King of <hi>Troy,</hi> for falſifying the Promiſſory Oath that he had made to <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Apollo;</hi> which vengance did not onely light upon him and his Age, but reacht unto poſterity. So that many years after, they cry'dout, <hi>Laomedonteae luimus perjuria Trojae. Herod,</hi> that could digeſt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Inceſt (hard bits one would think) yet bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled at Perjury; though the Oath was a raſh one and made but to a Girl, and that upon no valuable conſideration neither, yet his ſtomach (as vitated as it was) ſo nauſeated Perjury, that he would perform it. It ſeems it was accounted by them an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blaſphemy, to call God to Witneſs to a lie, to make truth it ſelf a lyar; but let the promiſe be made to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:107613:196"/> whom it would, how much more abominable muſt it needs be, when that promiſe is made to God? That is at the ſame time, to defraud and blaſpheme the Majeſty of Heaven: And ſo do all they who ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in the preſence of God covenant and ſwear to fight under his Banner againſt the World, and afterwards turn to the World, and enter into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Friendſhip with that which they had once declar'd their deadly Enemy. <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Fable, ſtomach'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Nature of Love is ſociable, it can endure any thing but ſolitude; this it can no more endure, than the Wind can endure to be, and not to blow. Now what proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Object of Love can there be, than one that loves us, or a thing that is our own. No one is our own ſo properly as he that loves us: I am more truly poſſeſt of a Friend that loves me, than of a Child that I carry in mine Arms, or Wife that I lay in my boſome, that cares not for me. Of all the World
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:107613:198"/> therefore God is moſt ours, becauſe he loves us beſt. The love that comes from above is ſtrong: We commonly obſerve that the love that comes down from Parents upon their Children, is ſtronger than that which riſes up from the Children to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. An Arrow falling from an high, wounds deeper: What deep impreſſions then in the hearts of Men, ſhould the Arrows of Love make, that are ſhot from above the higheſt Heavens? It is truly ſaid, That God hates nothing of what he hath made: His hatred of the Wicked and of the Devils, if we underſtand it aright, is not ſo much his hatred of them, as their hatred of him. There is no ſuch thing as hatred in the pure Nature of God, his Name is Love, and certainly he is nam'd according to his Nature. But ſpeaking after the manner of Men, he is ſaid to hate Evil-doers, onely to denote a contrariety of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Sin and Wickedneſs; as if one ſhould ſay Fire hates Water, or Light hates Darkneſs. It is a paſſage of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſomewhere in his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Diligo te Deus pluſquam mea, pluſquam meos, pluſquam me.</hi> That was a pure ſtrain of Devotion, and to be imitated by every Soul of Man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the nature of his Happineſs, and Relation wherein he ſtands to God: But if we alter the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar of it, it is as true Divinity ſtill, <hi>Deus diliget me pluſquam mea, pluſquam mei, pluſquam ego,</hi> God loves us better than all our Friends loves us, better than we our ſelves love our ſelves. Of all our Friends, our Relations are ſuppos'd to love us beſt; and of all Relations, our Parents. The Love of God towards us therefore, is compared to the love that a Father bears to his Son that ſerves him, and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to her Sucking Child. But it infinitely excels theſe, for what wretched Mortal can pretend to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:107613:198"/> love with that ſtrength and wiſdome as God loves. If we who are by Nature evil and impotent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, can love our Children tenderly, how much more doth our Heavenly Father? It is our Saviours own Argument, and it concludes as ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning loving, as concerning giving. And if giving good things be an Argument of Love, God loves us better than our Parents, for he has given us much more then our Parents could; for he hath given us noble Souls, and his Son to redeem them, yea and he gave us thoſe very Parents themſelves, who give us any good thing.</p>
                  <p>He loves us better than we love our ſelves. I am much taken with that expreſſion of the <hi>Satyriſt,</hi> (ſpeaking of the Gods, and their Providence towards Men) <hi>Charior eſt ipſis homo quam ſibi.</hi> Gods love towards us is purer and wiſer than our own. He loves us ſo well, that he will deny us things hurtful to us, though we pray for them; ſo well, that he will afflict us for our good, though it be ſore againſt our wills; ſo well, that he will remove us out of this world that we are ſo fond of, into a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which we poor Souls have little mind of.</p>

                  <p>To ſpeak properly, The Excellencies which we ſee in the ſeveral Creatures, are not the Perfections of this or that particular Being, but the perfections of God; for they are nothing but what he made them: and it is by ſtamping his own Beauty and Goodneſs upon them, that they are any of them in any kind good and beautiful; and indeed not only the Perfections and Ornaments of every particular Being are of God, but the very thing it ſelf.

                  <p>FIfthly, Conſider, that to love God, is to gain God. It may juſtly make one wonder to ſee Men take ſuch pains to gain the World, and yet ſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently affected to the enjoyment of God himſelf. Riſing up early, and lying down late, and eating the bread of ſorrows, deſcribes but a little of that pains and ſolicitouſneſs which men uſe for gaining the World, in compariſon of that compaſſing of Sea and Land, running of ſtrange hazards, adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Health and Life, Soul and all, in purſuit of Wealth and Honour, which we may every where diſcern amongſt the greedy Merchants, and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Courtiers and Warriers of the World. And after all this, it proves that they ſeek but a very mean thing, that they gain but a little of that which they ſeek, and that they are not ſatisfied with that which they gain.</p>
                  <p>Is it worth an Age of pains to gain the Creature, yea a ſmall handful of it, yea and ſuch an handful too, as is gone as ſoon as it is well gain'd; and can any Man that is Maſter of his Reaſon, chooſe but think it much more worthy of all poſſible endeavors to gain the Creator, and make the Supream good his own? Our Saviour ſeems to make a ſuppoſition of a thing not to be ſuppos'd, when he ſpeaks of a
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:107613:202"/> ſingle Man gaining the whole World (like unto which there are many Hyperbolical ſuppoſitions made in the Holy Scripture.) But the gaining of God is no Hyperbolical Suppoſal, but a Real Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. It is ſincerely propounded to the Sons of Men, and if they fail of it, it is their own fault and folly: It hath pleaſed God ſo to conſtitute the Rational Soul, that nothing beſides himſelf can be the happineſs of it: It is impoſſible in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, that any thing below infinite Truth and Goodneſs, ſhould ſatisfie the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Will of man, or that the ſame ſhould be any otherwiſe perfected, but in the poſſeſſion of this Bleſſed Object.

This being certain, it will as certainly follow that the loving of God, is the enjoyment of him: <hi>Dilige &amp; frueris.</hi> It is Love that Aſſimulates and Unites, and makes this bleſſed Object our own. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>That he that loveth Silver, ſhall not be ſatisfi'd with Silver;</hi> yea it is true alſo, that he that loveth Silver, oftentimes does not ſo much as poſſeſs Silver; poor men may be covetous as well as rich, and there are many in the World no doubt, whoſe hearts do mightily hanker after the World, that yet miſs of it; who purſue this ſhadow and it flies from them.

                  <p>Do men love the World becauſe it is pleaſant to them, they ſee and taſt and handle it? I confeſs the World by being ſo nigh our Senſes, does affect and charm them: But is not God as nigh to us as any thing in the World? The inviſible things of him, are ſeen by the things that are made, <hi>praeſentem monſtrat quae li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet herba deum.</hi> Well might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>He is not far from every one of us, (Act.</hi> 17. 27.) Which is but a Rhetorical Meioſis, for he is very nigh to every one of us; ſo nigh, that he is in us, and over us, and round about us; or rather indeed we are in him, who is the infinite Goodneſs and omnipotent Life, containing all things in himſelf. God is as nigh to our Reaſons as the World is to our Senſes, and it is as eaſie and obvious to conclude, that ſome one made the World, as it is to ſee that it is made.</p>
                  <p>Do men love the World becauſe they apprehend it
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:107613:206"/> neceſſary to them, they cannot live contentedly and pleaſantly, nor indeed live at all without it? This may be preſumed to be one of the faireſt excuſes for the Love of the World: For who can chooſe but love that which is neceſſary to Life? How can any man live without Money as the World goes? In extream old Age we ſhall be forſaken and miſerable, if we have not Eſtates, therefore we will ſtick at nothing to get them whilſt we are young.</p>
                  <p>This neceſſarineſs of the World may indeed juſtifie the moderate induſtry of Men for the obtaining of a competent Portion of it: but it will never juſtify co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting after abundance, nor the predominant Love of the World. For Life it ſelf, for whoſe ſake, we ſay, we Love the World, is in it ſelf but a mean thing, and not very deſirable; and in compariſon of the favour of God, abominable, and to be hated. But ſuppoſing Life never ſo deſirable, and conſequently the World neceſſary, and conſequently the Love of it juſtifiable, yet certainly God is more neceſſary to us than the World or any thing in it. Our Souls are ſure more excellent than our Lives, and conſequently the Grace of God, which is the Life and Happineſs of Souls, more neceſſary than the World can be to the maintainance of Life. It is not neceſſary to us to Live, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be Saved: If a Man loſe his Life he may find it again, but if he loſe his Soul, it is paſt Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
